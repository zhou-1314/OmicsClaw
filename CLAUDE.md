# CLAUDE.md — OmicsClaw repository

`OMICSCLAW.md` is the runtime contract of the OmicsClaw analysis agent:
`omicsclaw/entry/assembly.py` puts it at the top of that agent's system
prompt, followed by `SAFETY_RULES` and `TOOL_GUIDANCE` from the same module.
Read it when a change affects what that agent is told, and when adding or
removing a skill (its routing table and counts there are kept by hand).

## Repository Maintenance Contract

When you are acting on repository maintenance, refactoring, or other
developer-facing tasks rather than end-user omics analysis:

1. Read `README.md` for what the project is and `CHANGELOG.md` for recent
   decisions and milestones.
2. Then read root `SPEC.md` and `AGENTS.md`.
3. Reply in the user's language and stay concise and execution-focused.
4. Use a concise plan and root-cause debugging for non-trivial repository
   changes. Test by Risk-Matched Verification (`SPEC.md`): choose the level
   from what the change can break, run that level's checks, and report what
   you ran and what you did not. Do not run the full suite by default.
5. When you make an important repository decision or complete a milestone,
   add an entry at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`. Change `README.md` only when a
   user-facing entry point, install step or headline feature changes; its
   What's New holds at most five items of one sentence each.
6. Run the `humanizer` skill (`.claude/skills/humanizer/SKILL.md`) in
   embedded mode over prose you write: code comments, docstrings, docs,
   plans, README text, commit messages and PR descriptions. Keep code,
   commands, paths and identifiers unchanged.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and PRDs live in GitHub Issues for `zhou-1314/OmicsClaw`. Use the `gh`
CLI (`gh issue create|view|list|comment|edit|close`), and infer the repository
from the current clone unless a command needs an explicit
`--repo zhou-1314/OmicsClaw`. "Publish to the issue tracker" means create an
issue; "fetch the relevant ticket" means read its body, labels and comments.

### Triage labels

Five canonical roles, each mapping to the GitHub label of the same name:

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `needs-triage` | A maintainer must evaluate the issue. |
| `needs-info` | More information is required from the reporter. |
| `ready-for-agent` | Fully specified and safe for an AFK agent. |
| `ready-for-human` | Requires human implementation or judgement. |
| `wontfix` | Will not be actioned. |

The first four may not exist yet. Create one only when a workflow first needs
to apply it; never create or mutate labels during read-only diagnosis.
