"""Golden routing snapshot for ``capability_resolver`` (OMI-12 P2.9).

The resolver's scoring weights and decision thresholds (now lifted to
module-level constants in ``omicsclaw.skill.capability_resolver``) drive
which skill a natural-language query gets routed to. Adjusting any of
those weights — even reasonably — risks silently re-ranking real queries.
Without a fixed corpus to diff against, weight tuning becomes a guessing
game (see OMI-12 evaluation, P2.9).

This test pins **the current** ``chosen_skill`` / ``coverage`` /
``domain`` for ~20 representative queries spanning every domain plus the
no-skill / partial-skill / skill-creation decision boundaries.

The corpus deliberately includes a handful of *known* mis-routes
(``Run scRNA-seq preprocessing`` lands on ``spatial-preprocess``, WGCNA
lands on ``bulkrna-ppi-network``, XCMS lands on ``spatial-preprocess``).
Those are not aspirational — they pin the live behaviour so a future
weight change that silently shifts them shows up in the diff.

### Regenerating the snapshot

When you intentionally change routing behaviour, regenerate the snapshot:

    python -m scripts.update_golden_routing  # or:
    python -c "from tests.test_capability_resolver_golden import regenerate; regenerate()"

Then review the diff before committing.
