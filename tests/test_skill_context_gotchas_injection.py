"""Tests for ADR 2026-05-11: inject `## Known pitfalls` block from
SKILL.md Gotchas into `load_skill_context()` output.

Phase 1 contract: when the selected skill has gotchas in the registry,
`load_skill_context()` appends a `## Known pitfalls (from SKILL.md
Gotchas)` block listing every gotcha lead sentence as a bullet.  When
the skill has no gotchas, the block is omitted entirely (no empty
header).  An INFO log line records skill name + gotcha count + approx
token count for Phase 2 telemetry.
