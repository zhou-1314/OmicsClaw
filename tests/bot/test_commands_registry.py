"""Contract for the slash-command registry that replaced the
~250-line if-elif chain in bot/agent_loop.py:llm_tool_loop.

Phase 1 P0-E (Task #8). The registry lives in ``bot/commands/``
because the handlers read bot-side state (transcript_store,
DATA_DIR, format_skills_table, …) heavily — moving them to
``omicsclaw/engine/`` would require an even larger DI surface
than EngineDependencies and re-introduce reverse-import temptation.
