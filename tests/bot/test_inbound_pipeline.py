"""Contract test exposing the dead MessageBus / middleware pipeline.

Findings (May 2026 audit, verified at HEAD = e59f89d):

* ``bot/channels/bus.py`` defines ``MessageBus.publish_inbound`` but **no
  production code calls it**. The only ``publish_outbound`` callers live
  inside ``ChannelManager._consumer_loop`` — a loop that itself only runs
  if some channel pushes to ``publish_inbound``, which never happens.
* ``bot/channels/middleware.py`` (``MiddlewarePipeline``,
  ``RateLimit/Audit/Dedup/AllowList/TextLimit`` middlewares) is wired by
  ``bot/run.py:_build_middleware`` and threaded into
  ``ChannelManager(middleware=…)``, but because the consumer loop never
  fires the middleware never executes either.
* The production flow is direct: ``Channel._handle_message`` →
  ``core.llm_tool_loop`` (see ``bot/channels/telegram.py:464``,
  ``bot/channels/feishu.py:760``). Bus + middleware are dead weight.

ADR-0003 (Phase 1 task #3) selects deletion as the resolution. After
Phase 1 P0-A (task #4) ships, the ``xfail`` markers below should be
removed; the assertions then act as the strict guard against
re-introducing the dead pipeline.
