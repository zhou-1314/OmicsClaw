"""``.env.example`` describes the stack that exists, not the one that did.

The previous version of this file asserted that twenty-one names were
*substrings* of the template. That check could not fail in the way it
needed to: after the rebuild moved eight chat platforms and the legacy
memory service out of the reachable configuration, the template listed
them under "no longer read" —— and the substring test passed, because
the names were still on the page. A guard that cannot tell "you can set
this" from "this does nothing" is a spelling check.

So the two halves are asserted separately, against how the template is
*written* rather than what it mentions: a settable variable is one that
appears as ``NAME=`` or ``#NAME=`` at the start of a line, and a retired
one is named in prose inside the closing section.
