"""Architectural guardrail: ``omicsclaw/`` must not import from ``bot/``.

The dependency direction is one-way: user-facing entries (``bot/``,
``omicsclaw/app/``, ``omicsclaw/interactive/``) consume the engine
living in ``omicsclaw/``. The reverse — engine code reaching back
into ``bot/`` — creates cycles, blocks the boundary refactor planned
in ``docs/adr/0001-bot-core-decomposition.md``, and was the root
cause of multiple un-shippable migrations called out in the May 2026
audit.

The guardrail comes in two strengths:

1. **Top-level imports** (``import bot.x`` at module scope). These
   evaluate at import time and create real cycle risk. **Strictly
   forbidden** — this set must always be empty.

2. **Function-body lazy imports** (``import bot.x`` inside a
   ``def``/``async def``). These defer the dependency to call time
   and were used historically to side-step the cycle (see e.g.
   ``omicsclaw/runtime/preflight/sc_batch.py:265-267`` — the author's
   comment names the workaround explicitly). They are **technical
   debt**: tracked in ``GRANDFATHERED_LAZY_IMPORTS``, ratcheted
   monotonically, but do not block the test today.

Phase 1 P0-D landed the policy split (May 2026). Future cleanups
(scheduled as Phase 2 work) move the bot-side helpers into
``omicsclaw/`` so the lazy allowlist can shrink to zero.
