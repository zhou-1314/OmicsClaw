"""Snapshot of ``registry.skills`` shape — the public registry contract.

After the ``_HARDCODED_SKILLS`` deletion (PR registry-data-logic-split),
SKILL.md frontmatter is the single source of truth. This test pins the
*observable* contract so a future refactor that drops a name, drops a
field, or changes a field type fails loudly.

Pinned dimensions:
  - the canonical skill set (≥80 entries) is stable
  - every pre-rename canonical (e.g. ``spatial-preprocessing``) still
    resolves to the new canonical
  - every short legacy alias shipped in CLAUDE.md examples still
    resolves
  - each canonical entry exposes the documented field-and-type set
  - each domain entry exposes its required fields
