"""The three surface starters, and the branches nobody was standing over.

Plan 0037's review measured ``omicsclaw/launch/_surfaces.py`` at 297
statements with 83 never executed by any test, and made the point that
matters: the review then read those branches and found them **correct**. A
correct branch with no test is not a bug, it is a bug's future address —— the
next person who edits it gets no warning, and the file is the one that cuts
the command line for every deployment of this program.

This file stands over them. What is asserted here is deliberately the small
stuff —— a port bound, a channel name refused twice, a help flag answered ——
because that is what was uncovered; the process-level properties are in
``test_channel_command.py`` and ``test_cli_command.py``, where they need a
real process to mean anything.

**Every test here was run against the pre-fix code first.** A test that
cannot fail proves nothing, and plan 0037's own §8-4 is the cautionary tale:
a smoke that returned before the thing it smoked was started.
