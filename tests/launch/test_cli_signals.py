"""``oc cli`` stopped by ``SIGTERM`` or by its terminal closing.

Both are driven against the real command in a pseudo-terminal, because
every property below is about a process: which exit code a supervisor
reads, and which processes are still alive once it has exited.

**Why the CLI has to handle these two signals at all.** A shell command
the model runs, and a ``!`` command the operator runs, start in a session
of their own so that a timeout or a ``Ctrl-C`` can kill the whole process
group. The price is that nothing sent to the terminal's process group
reaches them any more: not the ``SIGHUP`` of a closed terminal window, and
not the ``SIGTERM`` that ``kill``, ``timeout -s TERM`` or a supervisor
sends. Left to the default disposition, the CLI died where it stood, and
``sleep 30 | cat`` ran on with nothing left to enforce its timeout.
Measured before the handlers existed: the CLI ended by the signal itself
(``-15`` and ``-1``) and ``bash``, ``sleep`` and ``cat`` were all alive
afterwards, on both paths.

**Why the elapsed time is asserted.** A running exchange is not only
abandoned: it is cancelled. Left to the release instead, it would be
given :data:`~omicsclaw.entry.assembly.SHUTDOWN_GRACE_S` to finish on its
own, a command that never finishes would hold the process that long, and
a supervisor that follows ``SIGTERM`` with ``SIGKILL`` would kill it
first. Finishing well inside that grace is what shows the exchange was
cancelled rather than waited for.

**Why a closed terminal is its own case.** After a hang-up the terminal
is gone and a write to it fails with ``EIO``. The shutdown still writes —
``prompt_toolkit`` restores the screen, the held log is replayed, the
interpreter flushes standard output on its way out — and a shutdown that
stopped at the first failed write would skip the release, report ``1``
and leave the command running. ``129`` can only be reported once the
release has finished.
