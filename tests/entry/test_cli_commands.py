"""The commands plan 0041 reconnected: sessions, resume, compact, tasks.

Every test here builds a **real**
:class:`~omicsclaw.entry.assembly.AgentApp` — real registry, real SQLite
session store under ``tmp_path``, real plan book — over the scripted
provider ``test_turn_runner.py`` defines, and reads what the surface
printed out of a :class:`io.StringIO`. The point of that is the same as
in ``test_cli_repl.py``: the commands below are all *wiring*, and a
double in the middle of wiring proves only that the double was called.

There is no ``pytest-asyncio`` on this machine, so every test drives
:func:`asyncio.run` itself and **every await is inside an
:func:`asyncio.wait_for`** — a defect in this loop shows up as a hang,
and a hang with no timeout plugin is a test run that never finishes.
