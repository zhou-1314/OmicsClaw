"""The composition root's obligation: nothing reaches the registry ungated.

:class:`~omicsclaw.permission.GatedTool` decorates a tool rather than the
registry, which buys the layer three properties
(``omicsclaw/permission/gate.py``) at one cost: a tool registered without
passing through :func:`~omicsclaw.permission.gate_tools` is not gated. That
cost is paid here, and this file is what holds :func:`build_app` to it.

The failure this guards against is quiet. An ungated tool still works — it
still asks for itself, still resolves its policy — so nothing breaks. It just
stops consulting the rule file and the dangerous-command patterns, and the
only way to notice is to look.
