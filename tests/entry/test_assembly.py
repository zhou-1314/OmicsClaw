"""The composition root, and the three seams that are silent when wrong.

Each of the three is a defect that compiles, runs and passes a loosely
written test:

*Two workspaces instead of one.* ``write_file`` and ``read_file`` would
each work perfectly, against different sandbox roots, and the agent would
write a file it cannot then find. Asserted by identity **and** by a real
write-then-read through the registry.

*A wrapped registry.* :class:`~omicsclaw.engine.DeadlineAwareExecutor`
and :class:`~omicsclaw.engine.ConcurrencyAwareExecutor` are
``runtime_checkable`` Protocols the engine tests with :func:`isinstance`.
A wrapper that forwards ``execute`` and ``available_tools`` but not
``use_timeout_pause`` passes every functional test and quietly stops the
timeout pause reaching the tools — which puts a human's approval time
back inside ``tool_timeout``. That is defect R3, and this layer is the
first thing in the rebuild that binds an approval channel.

*A summary timeout in the wrong place.* Wrapping
:func:`~omicsclaw.context.compact` in :func:`asyncio.timeout` and
wrapping the summarizer look identical in a test that asserts "it did not
hang"; the first produces *no compaction*, the second produces a
*degraded* one. Every assertion here is on ``record.degraded``.
