"""The loop, driven without a terminal.

Plan 0031 task D3. Every test here builds a **real**
:class:`~omicsclaw.entry.assembly.AgentApp` — real registry, real engine,
real context assembly — over the scripted provider
``test_turn_runner.py`` already defines, and reads what the surface
printed out of a :class:`io.StringIO`. That is only possible because the
input source and the console are both arguments (``cli.go:36``); a REPL

There is no ``pytest-asyncio`` on this machine, so every test drives
:func:`asyncio.run` itself, and **every await is inside an
:func:`asyncio.wait_for`**: a defect in a loop like this one shows up as a
hang, and a hang with no timeout plugin installed is a test run that never
finishes.
