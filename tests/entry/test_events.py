"""The event vocabulary of ``omicsclaw.entry.events`` (plan 0031, task C).

Nothing here touches transport or text — ``test_stream.py`` owns delivery
and ``test_render.py`` owns projection. What is left is the two decisions
that the other two files then depend on and cannot re-check:

1. **The droppable/control partition.** A bounded buffer is only as
   trustworthy as this split, and a member that drifts into the wrong
   half fails nowhere else: dropping ``APPROVAL_REQUIRED`` under load
   produces a deadlock in production and a green suite everywhere.
2. **The two scopes** (Q21). ``TURN_END`` is per *model call*;
   ``EXCHANGE_END`` is per *user round-trip*. The cheap way to break that
   is to give ``EngineEventType.DONE`` a frame, which would put two
   terminal frames on every successful exchange.
