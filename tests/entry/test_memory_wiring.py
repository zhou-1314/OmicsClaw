"""Memory, from the composition root to the next system prompt.

``omicsclaw/memory/`` was complete and unreachable: nothing constructed a
:class:`~omicsclaw.memory.Database`, so ``LongTermStore``, ``Precis``,
``MemoryExtractor`` and ``SqliteSessionStore`` had no caller and the
running agent remembered nothing. This file is the guard on the wiring
that closed that gap, and the questions it asks are the ones a diff
cannot answer on its own:

*Does a memory survive the round trip?* ``test_a_compaction_reaches_the_
next_system_prompt`` drives one compaction with a scripted summarizer and
then re-renders the prompt. Every assertion before it can be green while
the loop is open at one joint — the store never written, the précis never
rebuilt, the section holding a snapshot taken before either.

*Do the summarizer and the extractor stay the same decision?* They are
two fields of one app and the extractor needs the first. Building it once
at assembly time compiles, passes an "extraction happened" test, and then
calls a summarizer the app was later given a different one of — which is
how four compaction tests in this suite went red: their substituted
summarizer was ignored and the extraction ran against the scripted
*provider* instead, eating replies the test had counted.

*Is a search honest about writing?* ``LongTermStore.search`` raises the
use count of every hit, because that counter is what stops an entry being
proposed as stale. A policy claiming ``read_only`` would be a claim the
tool does not keep, and the gate above it is entitled to believe it.
