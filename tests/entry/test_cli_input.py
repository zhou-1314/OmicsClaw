"""The prompt sources, read the way the REPL really reads them.

:class:`~omicsclaw.entry.cli._repl.Repl` answers every approval request
from its own Task, so a model message carrying two calls to
concurrency-safe ASK tools — ``web_fetch`` and ``web_search`` are the two
the registry mounts — puts two :meth:`PromptSource.read` calls in flight
at once. ``tests/entry/test_cli_repl.py`` drives that case through
:class:`~omicsclaw.entry.cli.ScriptedSource`, which is a list and happily
serves both; a terminal is not a list, and these tests are about the
difference.

There is no ``pytest-asyncio`` here, so every test drives
:func:`asyncio.run` itself and bounds every await with
:func:`asyncio.wait_for` — an unserialized source shows up as a hang, and
a hang with no timeout plugin is a test run that never finishes.
