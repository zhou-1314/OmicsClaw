"""Asking a human without deadlocking the loop that is waiting.

Plan 0031 trap 1, Q12 and Q18. The broker is the only object in this
package whose whole purpose is to suspend one Task until a *different*
one answers, so every test here either resolves the question from
another Task or asserts a refusal — and each one carries its own
:func:`asyncio.wait_for`, because a broker bug is a hang and this suite
has no timeout plugin.
