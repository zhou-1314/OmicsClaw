"""The reply pump: what it closes, what it batches, and who may answer it.

Plan 0031 task D1's two standing obligations live here, and both of them
are obligations the layers below **cannot** discharge:

1. ``TurnStream.observer_count()`` does not fall when an ``async for``
   breaks — an object with ``__anext__`` gives Python no ``break`` hook —
   so the grace period that abandons an unwatched exchange starts only if
   this surface calls ``aclose()``. Not calling it is safe in direction and
   leaks a running Task forever, which is the failure mode nobody notices
   because nothing goes wrong.
2. ``ApprovalBroker.settle`` resolves an :class:`asyncio.Future` and is
   only safe on the loop's own thread. Several vendor SDKs deliver their
   callbacks on their own. The hop is
   :meth:`ChannelRuntime.settle_approval_threadsafe`, and the test for it
   below uses a real :class:`threading.Thread` because the defect it is
   about does not exist in a single-threaded reproduction.

Every wait is bounded by :data:`WAIT_S`. A surface defect is a hang, and
this machine has no timeout plugin.
