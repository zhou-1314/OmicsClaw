"""The Desktop SSE body: every token, a resumable cursor, one ending.

Plan 0031 task D2, Q14, Q24 and traps 9 and 13. The file opens with the
defect that drove this task's design — a burst of deltas published between
two of the provider's ``await`` points, against an observer buffer sized for
a *slow* reader rather than an *unscheduled* one — because everything after
it is downstream of how that was answered.

The doubles come from ``test_turn_runner.py``: the app under test is the
real composition root over a scripted backend, so the burst these tests
publish is produced by the real engine rather than by hand.
