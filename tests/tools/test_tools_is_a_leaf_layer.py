"""``omicsclaw/tools/`` may import ``omicsclaw.schema`` and nothing else.

Plan 0028 §9-4, and the reason it is written as strictly as it is: plan
0028 §4 Q7 cancelled the task that would have moved the legacy tool layer
out of ``omicsclaw.runtime.tools``, on the grounds that a package name
only stops a human reviewer. **This file is therefore the sole mechanism
enforcing the boundary.** If it is weak, there is nothing behind it.

Three ways it is stricter than its counterparts in ``tests/schema/``,
``tests/provider/`` and ``tests/engine/``:

*A whitelist, not a blacklist.* Only ``omicsclaw.schema`` is permitted
inside the ``omicsclaw`` namespace — not ``provider``, not ``engine``, and
not ``runtime.tools``. Naming what is forbidden would mean predicting
every package a future step adds; naming what is allowed does not.

*Relative imports are resolved, not skipped.* The engine's counterpart
skips ``ImportFrom`` nodes with a non-zero level on the reasoning that
they stay inside the package. That is false above level one:
``from ..runtime import tools`` is a relative import that leaves. Plan
0028 §6 records that a grep for ``runtime.tools`` missed seven files
written exactly that way, so the level is resolved to an absolute module
name before it is judged.

*Third parties are checked against the standard library*, via
:data:`sys.stdlib_module_names`, rather than against a list of the
libraries someone thought of. Importing a tool must never require an
optional extra to be installed.

**The fourth strictness was bought with a hole.** An ``ast`` walk that
looks only at ``Import`` and ``ImportFrom`` nodes cannot see
``importlib.import_module("omicsclaw.runtime.tools.validation")``, and
neither could the subprocess probe below, which inspected
:data:`sys.modules` at *import* time while the offending import happens
in a function body called later. Replacing ``validate_arguments``' body
with a four-line delegation to the legacy validator left all of this
green — so the sole mechanism enforcing the boundary did not enforce the
one crossing plan 0028 §5 names by hand ("reuse ``validation.py``"). Two
checks close it: :func:`_dynamic_import_calls` refuses the call forms at
source level, and
:func:`test_running_the_tools_does_not_pull_in_a_single_runtime_module`
runs the layer and inspects :data:`sys.modules` **afterwards**, which is
the only check that does not depend on guessing the syntax.

def test_the_public_surface_is_exactly_what_the_two_plans_delivered():
    """``__init__`` is an interface, so widening it should be deliberate.

    Renamed from ``…_what_tasks_a_b_and_c_delivered``: that named plan
    0028's three tasks, and plan 0029 has its own A/B/C/D, so the old name
    had quietly become ambiguous about which A it meant.

    Task B extended this list — the two adapters, their one public
    exception, and the whole of the out-of-band context convention — and
    updating it here is how that extension got noticed rather than
    absorbed. Plan 0029 extended it by three — ``read_tool``,
    ``WriteTool``, ``BashTool`` — and the owner's removal of plan 0028's
    three reference tools shrank it by four, which is the same mechanism
    working in the other direction.

    The context names dominate because the convention *is* the deliverable:
    a surface has to be able to bind a channel (``use_tool_context``,
    ``set_tool_context``) and a tool has to be able to read one
    (``require_approval``, ``report_progress``, ``context_value``) without
    either importing a private module.

    The repair round added the last two of those: ``use_effective_policy``
    and ``effective_policy``. They are the wire that makes
    ``register(policy=)`` mean something at execution time — the registry
    publishes what ``policy_for`` resolved, ``require_approval`` reads it
    — and they are exported rather than kept private because a dispatcher
    that is not this registry has to be able to publish one, and a tool
    written against the Protocol may want to read one. Exporting only the
    reader would leave the binder to be re-invented, which is how two
    implementations of one rule start.

    **The parallel-tool-calling round added three more**, on that same
    argument and for the second thing a dispatcher publishes:
    ``TimeoutPause``, ``use_timeout_pause`` and ``pause_tool_timeout`` are
    how the engine's per-call timeout is stopped while a human decides. A
    dispatcher other than this registry has to be able to publish one, and
    a tool that waits on a person has to be able to enter one, without
    either reaching into ``omicsclaw.engine`` or into a private module
    here.

    One of the three foundation tools is a factory and two are classes,
    which reads as an inconsistency and is not: ``read_file`` is a
    :class:`~omicsclaw.tools.function_tool.FunctionTool` and a function is
    not a tool until something configures one, while a hand-written tool
    already has a constructor. ``read_file`` is hand-written's opposite
    for a reason — it is the only one of the three that never asks a
    human, so it is the only one that does not need the bytes the model
    sent.

    **Plan 0029 adds exactly three**, and the count is the interesting
    part. Its task A delivered ``_workspace.py`` and ``_pathlock.py`` and
    widened this list by **nothing**: they are helpers that ``read``,
    ``write``, ``edit`` and ``bash`` share, not tools a surface mounts,
    and the underscore is the whole statement. Its task B adds
    ``read_tool`` and ``WriteTool`` — the same factory-versus-constructor
    asymmetry as above, for the same reason: ``read`` is a
    :class:`~omicsclaw.tools.function_tool.FunctionTool` and needs
    configuring, ``write`` is hand-written and already has a constructor.
    Its task C adds ``BashTool``, hand-written for ``write``'s reason —
    an ``ASK`` tool's approval prompt has to show the bytes the model
    sent — so it is a constructor too.

    **Plan 0029's §12 follow-ups add three more, and the same arithmetic
    holds.** ``EditTool`` completes the canonical file set and is
    hand-written for ``write``'s reason. ``WebFetchTool`` and
    ``WebSearchTool`` were ruled back into scope by the owner on
    2026-09-18, against plan 0029 §2, and are hand-written for the same
    reason again — both ask a human, and what a person reviewing a
    request needs to see is the URL exactly as the model spelled it.
    ``_websafety.py`` and ``_html.py`` widen this list by **nothing**,
    exactly as task A's two helpers did: an SSRF gate and an HTML reducer
    are things the tools stand on, not things a surface mounts.

    What is deliberately absent: ``Workspace``, ``read_lock`` and
    ``write_lock``, the four ``Environment`` Protocols, ``Transport``,
    ``PinnedTransport``, ``UrlRefused`` and ``CommandOutcome``. A surface
    that genuinely needs one imports the module that defines it; putting
    them here would make the package surface the place to look for
    internals. ``UrlRefused`` is the one worth arguing about, since a
    surface may want to recognise a blocked-URL refusal — but
    :exc:`~omicsclaw.tools._workspace.PathRefused` is not exported either,
    and inventing an exception hierarchy on the package surface for one of
    the two boundaries would be the inconsistency.

    ``ask_every_time`` (plan 0049) is here for the same reason
    ``use_effective_policy`` is: it is the permission gate's half of a
    channel whose other half, :func:`require_approval`, a tool calls.

    **Plan 0054 adds eight: ``AskUserTool`` and the question channel.** The
    seven context names are the channel's two ends, as with approval. A
    surface binds a ``QuestionChannel`` and answers a ``QuestionRequest``
    (with its ``QuestionOption`` entries) with a ``QuestionAnswer`` whose
    ``AnswerStatus`` says how it ended; a tool calls ``ask_question`` and
    may catch ``QuestionUnavailable``. ``option_numbers`` and the tool's
    bounds stay in ``omicsclaw.tools.builtin.ask_user``, as each other
    tool's constants stay in its own module.
