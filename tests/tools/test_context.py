"""Contract tests for ``omicsclaw.tools.context`` (plan 0028, task B).

Plan 0028 trap 11 is the reason this file imports ``omicsclaw.engine``.
The mechanism under test is not "a ``contextvar`` can be read back"; it is
"a value a surface set before the turn is readable **inside a tool running
in a worker the engine started**". Those are different claims, and only
the second is worth anything: ``execute_tool_calls`` schedules each call
with :func:`asyncio.ensure_future`, and whether the ambient context
survives that hop is a property of the engine that this package depends on
and does not control. So every propagation test here drives the real
``execute_tool_calls`` with a real :class:`~omicsclaw.tools.ToolRegistry`,
and none of them reads a variable back in the coroutine that set it.

**The layering rule does not apply to this file.** Plan 0028 §9-4 forbids
``omicsclaw/tools/`` — the *package* — from importing anything but
``omicsclaw.schema``, and ``test_tools_is_a_leaf_layer.py`` enforces it by
globbing ``omicsclaw/tools/**/*.py``. ``tests/tools/`` is not scanned,
which is correct: a test proving the production rule holds has to be able
to see both sides of it.

The other subject is plan 0028 §4 Q4's five questions. Each has at least
one named test, and the fourth — what an unbound approval channel means —
has three, because it is the only one of the five whose wrong answer is a
security hole rather than a bug.
