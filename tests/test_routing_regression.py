"""Routing regression suite for the Stage 2–4 architecture.

These are behavior tests for the end-to-end router as used by the bot:

* ``resolve_capability`` scores all 88 skills
* close top-1/top-2 gap (< ``_AUTO_DISAMBIGUATE_GAP``) triggers disambiguation
* file extension should disambiguate between cross-domain same-name skills

Cases are declared as data (not a test function per query) so adding coverage
stays a one-line change. Every row asserts either a ``chosen_skill`` or an
``ambiguous`` signal — never both — so drift shows up as a specific failure.
