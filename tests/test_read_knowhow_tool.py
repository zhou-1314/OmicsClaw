"""Tests for the ``read_knowhow(name)`` RAG tool.

Phase 2 (Task 2.3) of the system-prompt-compression refactor. Pairs with
the headline-only mode (Task 2.2): the system prompt only ships
``→ {label}: {critical_rule}`` summaries; the model fetches the full
body on demand by name.

These tests pin three behaviors:
1. ``KnowHowInjector.read_knowhow(name)`` resolves by filename, doc_id,
   or human-readable label and returns the full markdown body.
2. Unknown names return a clear error message — not an exception — so
   tool-call failures don't stall the conversation.
3. The runtime tool spec is registered with the right description hint
   so the model knows when to call it.
