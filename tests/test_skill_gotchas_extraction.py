"""Tests for SKILL.md `## Gotchas` extraction (ADR 2026-05-11).

These cover the LazySkillMetadata.gotchas property that parses the body of
a SKILL.md file and returns the lead sentence of each Gotcha bullet.  The
lead sentence is the bold-marked first sentence (between `**...**`); when
no bold marker is present, the first sentence (split on '. ') is used as
a fallback.  Template placeholders (italic `_None yet…_`) yield an empty
list so unfilled scaffolds do not pollute the runtime injection.
