"""Every skill main script answers ``--help`` (plan 0062 case 24).

Slow; uses the interpreter named by ``OMICSCLAW_TEST_BASE_PYTHON`` (see
``test_sc_scripts_help.py``). The four consensus shells, which import the
unimportable ``omicsclaw.runtime.consensus``, are out of the index (their
``SKILL.md`` is renamed ``SKILL.md.disabled``), so :func:`main_scripts` no
longer finds them and every script it finds must answer.
