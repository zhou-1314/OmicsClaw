"""``omicsclaw/context/`` may import ``omicsclaw.schema`` and nothing else.

Plan 0030 §9-2 and decision Q2, and copied — as
``FRAMEWORK-REBUILD.md:296-300`` instructs steps 5 and 6 to do — from
the *repaired* guard in ``tests/tools/test_tools_is_a_leaf_layer.py``
rather than from the weaker one beside the engine. The differences
matter here for the same reasons they mattered there, and one of them
matters more: this layer is the one with a standing temptation to reach
for ``omicsclaw.provider``, because ``get_model_limits`` lives there and
a context window is exactly what a budget wants.

*A whitelist, not a blacklist.* Only ``omicsclaw.schema`` is permitted
inside the ``omicsclaw`` namespace. Naming what is forbidden would mean
predicting every package a future step adds; naming what is allowed does
not.

*Relative imports are resolved, not skipped.* ``from ..provider import
get_model_limits`` is a relative import that leaves the package, so the
level is resolved to an absolute module name before it is judged.

*Third parties are checked against the standard library*, via
:data:`sys.stdlib_module_names`. This layer must import on a machine
with no ``tiktoken`` and no vendor SDK, because that is the machine it
was written on and because an optional dependency that silently changes
a budget is not optional.

**And the fourth check is behavioural.** An ``ast`` walk that reads only
``Import`` and ``ImportFrom`` nodes cannot see a module named as a
string inside a function body. :func:`_dynamic_import_calls` refuses the
call forms at source level, and
:func:`test_running_the_layer_does_not_pull_in_a_single_runtime_module`
runs every real path this package has in a fresh process and inspects
:data:`sys.modules` **afterwards** — static checks inspect spelling,
only a behavioural probe inspects fact.
