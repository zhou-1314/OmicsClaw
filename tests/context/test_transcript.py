    One renderer, and its output goes to the summarizer and never back
    into the model's own view. That is the whole reason it can be plain
    prose: prose the model reads triggers few-shot imitation — it starts
    narrating tool calls instead of making them — which is why the
    replaced layer rendered them as ``<prior-tool-calls/>``. A second
    renderer would be somebody quietly restoring the template-summary
    path, and this test is what notices.

    **The predicate is deliberately loose about spelling**, because the
    first version was not and could be stepped around without trying:
    it asked for ``Sequence`` *and* ``Message`` in an argument
    annotation and for a return annotated exactly ``str``, so
    ``list[Message] -> str`` and ``Sequence[Message] -> str | None``
    were both invisible to it. A structural guard that a rename defeats
    is a guard that will be defeated by accident. It also walks the

    a class or a factory is not a hiding place.
