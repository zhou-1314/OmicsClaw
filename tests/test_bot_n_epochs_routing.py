"""Regression test for the dead ``spatial-domain-identification`` --epochs
conditional removal.

The bot used to branch on ``canonical_skill == "spatial-domain-identification"``
to pick between ``--epochs`` and ``--n-epochs``. The registry resolves that
alias to canonical ``spatial-domains`` before this code runs, so the branch
was dead — the bot always emitted ``--n-epochs`` and relied on
``argv_builder.filter_forwarded_args`` to rewrite ``--n-epochs`` to
``--epochs`` (or vice versa) per each skill's ``allowed_extra_flags``.

This test pins the simplification so a future "helpful" branch
re-introduction has to break a test.
