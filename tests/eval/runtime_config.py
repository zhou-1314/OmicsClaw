"""Eval runtime config resolver.

Single source of truth for the eval suite's effective LLM endpoint, model,
and API key. Delegates to ``omicsclaw.providers.registry.resolve_provider``
so the same env semantics that drive ``bot/run.py`` also drive the eval
fixtures — when production runs DeepSeek v4-flash, eval measures DeepSeek
v4-flash, not a hard-coded foreign default.

The ``EVAL_MODEL`` env var is the eval-only override and trumps
``OMICSCLAW_MODEL`` / provider preset; it lets the nightly cron sweep
alternate models without touching the production-facing ``.env``.
