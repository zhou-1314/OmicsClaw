"""Phase 3 (Task 3.1) RED tests pinning the deletion of the
``role_guardrails`` injector and its public surface.

Once Phase 3 lands, every external entry point that referenced
``role_guardrails`` must be gone — the SOUL.md single-source content
covers what used to live in this layer, and the surface-conditional
voice rules move to the ``surface_voice_rules`` layer.
