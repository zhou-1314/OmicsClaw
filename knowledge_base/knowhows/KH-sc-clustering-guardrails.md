# Single-Cell Clustering Guardrails

- **Inspect first**: clustering should start from normalized expression plus PCA or an integrated embedding, not from raw counts.
- **Do not collapse preprocessing and clustering into one vague step**: `sc-preprocessing` prepares the normalized PCA-ready object; `sc-clustering` consumes that object for graph construction, embedding, and clustering.
- **Ask about batch effects before clustering**: if likely batch/sample columns are present and no integrated embedding exists, remind the user to consider `sc-batch-integration` first.
- **Make the representation explicit when needed**: if more than one embedding exists, ask the user which one should drive neighbors. `use_rep` is a real tuning decision, not an internal implementation detail.
- **Expose the real tuning knobs**: `n_neighbors`, `resolution`, `use_rep`, and `embedding_method` are the main first-pass controls; then expose the method-specific parameters that belong to the selected embedding backend (`umap`, `tsne`, `diffmap`, `phate`).
- **Point to the next analysis step**: after clustering, the usual next branches are `sc-markers`, `sc-cell-annotation`, and `sc-de`.
- **Guide beginners explicitly**: if the user just says “cluster this data”, explain that this step expects a normalized PCA-ready object, state the first-pass defaults that will be used, and remind them when batch integration should happen first.
- **Preserve the contract**: successful runs should emit `processed.h5ad`, a standard gallery, figure-data CSVs, and the reproducibility bundle.
