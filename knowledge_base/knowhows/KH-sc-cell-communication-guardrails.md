# Single-Cell Communication Guardrails

- **Inspect first**: confirm that the chosen `cell_type_key` contains biologically interpretable labels rather than raw QC groups.
- **Key wrapper controls**: explain `method`, `cell_type_key`, and `species` before running.
- **Use method-correct language**: LIANA and CellChat both depend on how cells are grouped; the grouping column is therefore the most important user-facing control in this wrapper.
- **Do not invent unsupported knobs**: official LIANA and CellChat workflows expose extra filters such as expression cutoffs and permutation settings, but the current OmicsClaw wrapper does not expose them.
- **Do not overclaim species support**: if the ligand-receptor database coverage is uncertain for the requested species, say so.
