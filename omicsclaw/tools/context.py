"""Out-of-band channels: how a running tool reaches the caller that started it.

Plan 0028 §4 Q4. The seam step 3 published is ``execute(call)`` — one
argument, and deliberately not a ``ctx``. Go's ``context.Context`` carries
*values* as well as cancellation, and the reference harness uses that half
for seven keys, of which this module reproduces two: an approval callback
handed to the tool executor (``hooks/decision.go:60``) and a progress sink
handed to sub-agent streaming (``hooks/subagent_progress.go:18``). Python
has an environment-carried equivalent that does not require widening a
published Protocol, so this module is what the Go ``ctx`` value half
becomes: :mod:`contextvars`.

**Of the five not reproduced, three are observability spans and two are a
mechanism worth naming.** ``approvedContextKey`` and
``explicitlyAllowedContextKey`` (``hooks/decision.go:74`` and ``:89``,
read at ``hooks/hook.go:87``) mark a *call* as already decided, so one
tool call asks a human **at most once** however many layers of the hook
chain want to ask. There is no equivalent here: :func:`require_approval`
asks every time it is called. Every tool in this package calls it once, so
nothing is wrong today — but a wrapping tool (a skill wrapper, an MCP
proxy, a future sub-agent tool) would prompt twice, and the layer that
would own the fix is the hook layer this package deliberately does not
have.

That this works at all rests on one property of the engine:
``engine/executor.py`` runs each call in its own :class:`asyncio.Task`,
and ``Task.__init__`` calls :func:`contextvars.copy_context`, so every
worker runs on a **copy of the context current when the turn's tools were
scheduled**. A variable set by a surface before the turn is therefore
readable inside a tool running three levels down, and the engine needs no
change at all. A property nobody wrote down is a coincidence waiting to be
refactored away, so it is written down here, and
``tests/tools/test_context.py`` asserts it through the real
``execute_tool_calls`` rather than by reading a variable back in the
coroutine that set it.

**What would break it is narrower than it looks.** Neither
:class:`asyncio.TaskGroup` nor :func:`asyncio.gather` is a threat —
both create Tasks, and a Task copies. The two that are: awaiting a call
**inline** rather than in a Task, which leaves every tool writing into
the turn's own context; and creating the Tasks with one shared
``context=``, which is the only spelling that makes several workers share
a mutable context on purpose.

**The five questions plan 0028 §4 Q4 requires answering, answered.**

1. *What is carried — a value or a reference?* **A reference.** The
   variable holds the approval *callback* and the progress *sink*, never
   an approval result. A decision that was computed before the tool ran
   cannot be about the arguments the tool actually received, and a tool
   that must block until a human clicks needs something it can await.
   :func:`require_approval` awaits the callback, so the round trip is the
   callback's own business — see :class:`ApprovalRequest`.

2. *Who sets it?* **The surface** (CLI, Desktop, Channel), once, before
   entering the agent turn — :func:`use_tool_context` or
   :func:`set_tool_context`.

3. *Who reads it?* **The concrete tool**, inside its own ``execute``.
   :class:`~omicsclaw.tools.registry.ToolRegistry` reads neither channel
   and still has no opinion about approval: it makes them exist and takes
   no part in what travels down them. A registry that *enforced* approval
   would have to know who is asking, which is precisely the knowledge
   plan 0028 trap 12 keeps out of it.

   It does publish two things, and it has to. The first is the policy in
   force for a call, resolved by
   :meth:`~omicsclaw.tools.registry.ToolRegistry.policy_for` — the
   deployment's ``register(policy=)`` outranking the author's
   ``tool.policy``, per plan 0028 §4 Q5 — and a tool asking with the
   policy *it* holds would be asking with the author's, never the
   deployment's. That made the whole of Q5 decorative in the one
   direction that matters: a deployment tightening ``AUTO`` to ``ASK``
   gated nothing, because the tool went on self-approving from its own
   ``AUTO``. So :meth:`~omicsclaw.tools.registry.ToolRegistry.execute`
   binds its resolution through :func:`use_effective_policy` and
   :func:`require_approval` reads it from there. Publishing a resolution
   is not enforcing it; the registry still neither asks nor decides.

   The second is the scheduler's :data:`TimeoutPause`, bound through
   :func:`use_timeout_pause` from what the engine handed the registry for
   this call. Same shape and same reason: the thing a tool needs is owned
   by a layer the tool may not import, so the dispatcher in the middle
   passes it down instead.

4. *What happens when nothing is set?* **Fail closed.**
   :func:`require_approval` raises :exc:`ApprovalUnavailable` when a tool
   needs consent and no channel is bound, which the registry turns into an
   ``is_error`` Observation naming the reason. The absent channel is never
   read as consent. Progress is the opposite and deliberately so: a
   missing sink is the normal case, so :func:`report_progress` is a no-op
   that reports having done nothing.

5. *Can two sessions cross?* **Only if they share an asyncio Task.**
   ``contextvars`` isolates per Task, not per coroutine call, so two
   concurrent sessions in one process — which the Channel Surface has by
   construction, Telegram and Feishu conversations interleaving on one
   event loop — are isolated **iff each top-level session runs in its own
   Task**. Two sessions binding a context inside one shared Task is a
   real defect with a plausible-looking diff: the second ``set`` wins, and
   one user's tool call is offered to the other user's approval prompt.
   Both halves have a test.

**Not a general-purpose bag with two extras bolted on.** The two named
channels are named because they are the two that need a *reference*.
:attr:`ToolContext.values` carries the flat per-turn facts the existing
tool layer injects through ``ToolSpec.context_params`` — ``session_id``,
``chat_id``, ``surface``, ``workspace``, ``thread_id`` and the rest — and
exists so plan 0028 §5's "must have a one-for-one replacement" is true
rather than aspirational. It is deliberately untyped: this layer must not
learn what a ``surface`` is.

**A human's thinking time is no longer charged to the tool's timeout.**
``engine/executor.py::_execute`` wraps ``executor.execute(call)`` in
``asyncio.timeout(config.tool_timeout)`` — sixty seconds by default —
while Q4.3 above puts the approval await *inside* the tool's own
``execute``, so the two nest the wrong way round and a user who took
longer than ``tool_timeout`` to press "approve" used to have the tool
cancelled and the model told ``tool 'X' timed out after 60s``: false
(nothing ran long, nobody answered) and actively misleading, since it
sends the model to make the tool faster. :func:`asyncio.shield` was never
the fix — the outer budget still raises at the next await point in this
task — so the fix is the engine lifting its own deadline: it offers the
call a :data:`TimeoutPause`, :func:`require_approval` enters it around
the round trip, and the seconds that were left are restored on the way
out. The engine's half is ``DeadlineAwareExecutor``, and the registry is
what carries it here.

A pause stops the clock; it does not bound the wait. **A surface that
asks a person still owns the deadline on its own prompt** — an IM bot
posting an approval card runs its own timer and answers "nobody
responded" itself, so the refusal the model reads is the true one. What
changed is that missing that deadline is now the surface's own report
rather than a fabricated tool timeout.

It owns one more thing, and it is the shape that hangs. **Whatever
answers an :class:`ApprovalRequest` must be able to make progress while
the consumer of ``execute_tool_calls`` is suspended between events** — a
separate Task, or an ``await`` on the request queue from inside the
``async for`` body. A consumer that only *polls* for requests between
events never sees one, because the request is issued after it has gone
back to waiting for the next event. Before the pause, such a consumer was
released by ``tool_timeout`` — with the false sentence above — so this is
a hazard the pause exposed rather than one it introduced. The reference
harness has the same hazard in its own shape and spends eight lines on it
at ``stream.go:51-58``.

**Leaf-adjacent.** ``omicsclaw.tools.base`` and the standard library.

    3. ``ToolPolicy()``, whose ``approval_mode`` is ``ASK``, so the
       forgetful call asks rather than proceeds.

    The order is this way round because the reverse is not a preference
    but a hole: a deployment tightening a tool from ``AUTO`` to ``ASK``
    through ``register(policy=)`` would be ignored by a tool that went on
    self-approving from the ``AUTO`` its author wrote, and the tightening
    would show up in ``policy_for`` — where an operator would read it and
    believe it — while changing nothing at execution time. Note that
    step 1 already *contains* step 2's answer whenever a deployment named
    no policy, because that is what ``policy_for`` resolves to.

    :attr:`~omicsclaw.tools.base.ApprovalMode.DENY_UNLESS_TRUSTED` is put
    to the channel exactly like ``ASK``. Whether a caller is trusted is
    knowledge the channel's owner has and this layer does not; with no
    channel bound it is the same refusal, which is the right answer for
    the stricter of the two modes.

    **The absence of a channel is not consent.** That is the whole of
    plan 0028 §4 Q4's fourth question, and it is decided here rather than
    per tool because a security default chosen forty times is a security
    default chosen inconsistently.

    **The human's thinking time is not charged to the tool's timeout.**
    The round trip to the channel runs inside :func:`pause_tool_timeout`,
    so a person who takes longer than ``EngineConfig.tool_timeout`` to
    decide no longer has the tool cancelled and reported to the model as
    having run long. The pause does not bound the wait — a channel that
    never answers blocks the call — so a surface that posts an approval
    card owns the deadline on its own prompt and answers "nobody
    responded" itself, which is the refusal the model can act on.
