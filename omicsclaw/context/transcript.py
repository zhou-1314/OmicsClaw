"""``omicsclaw/context`` — message lists in, message lists out.

Plan 0030 task C. Pure transforms over a conversation: no clock, no
I/O, no model. Everything here is ``(messages, budget) -> messages``,
which is what makes the whole compaction story testable without
inventing half a session to test it in.

**Every return value is a tuple, and none of them is the caller's
list.** The reference harness has a scar here: issue #117 was an
aliasing bug, and ``progressive_compactor.go:354-360`` still carries the
defensive copy and the explanation. Python looks safer than it is —
:class:`~omicsclaw.schema.Message` is frozen, so no single entry can be
edited behind a caller's back — but a returned *slice* of the caller's
list is the same bug in a different spelling: one ``append`` and two
conversations are one conversation.

**Nothing here truncates a message.** Capacity is solved at the
granularity of whole messages — :func:`fit_to_budget` peels them off the
front, :func:`emergency_fit` skips the ones that do not fit — never by
shortening one. In particular
:attr:`~omicsclaw.schema.ToolCall.arguments` is never rewritten: ADR
0077 requires it to stay the unparsed JSON text the model emitted, byte
for byte, because prompt-prefix caching and replay evidence both read
those bytes. A truncated argument payload is also an *invalid* one,
which the model will be handed and will retry against forever.

:func:`drop_unanswered_calls` is the one function here that edits a
message. It takes whole tool calls off a turn so that the conversation
is one the API accepts, and it leaves the text and the arguments of what
it keeps as they were.

    """Make every tool call and tool result find its partner, **in place**.

    Two repairs, in both directions, ported from ``compaction.go:
    195-239``: a tool result whose call is gone is dropped, and a tool
    call whose result is gone gets a placeholder result inserted
    directly after it. The Anthropic Messages API refuses a conversation
    where either is unpaired, so this is not tidiness — it is the
    difference between a compacted history and a 400.

    **Pairing is adjacency, not membership.** The Go tests two sets of
    ids and so did the first version of this function, and both are
    weaker than the rule they are defending. Anthropic requires every
    ``tool_use`` block of an assistant turn to be answered by a
    ``tool_result`` block in the *immediately following* user turn, and
    ``anthropic_provider.py:271-291`` flushes its batch of pending
    results the moment any other message interrupts them. A membership
    test says "the answer is somewhere in this list" and that is not the
    same statement. It goes wrong on parallel tool calls: an assistant
    turn asking for ``c0`` and ``c1`` whose ``c0`` result survives and
    whose ``c1`` result ends up behind a compaction summary encodes as
    ``assistant[tool_use c0, tool_use c1]``, ``user[tool_result c0]``,
    ``user[text]``, ``user[tool_result c1]`` — ``c1`` unanswered where it
    has to be answered, which is the 400 this function exists to
    prevent. So the answers an assistant turn may keep are exactly the
    contiguous run of ``Role.TOOL`` messages behind it; anything else
    wearing that role is unpaired wherever it happens to sit, and every
    call the run does not answer gets a placeholder.

    **Two lines of the Go cannot be taken literally.**

    *Which message is a tool result.* The harness asks
    ``m.ToolCallID != ""``, because its schema has three roles and folds
    observations into ``user``. This repository has a fourth role and
    the Anthropic adapter dispatches on it — ``Role.TOOL`` at
    ``anthropic_provider.py:276`` — so the test here is the role. A
    repair that used a different criterion than the adapter would be
    repairing something the adapter cannot see.

    *What the placeholder is.* The harness builds
    ``Message{Role: RoleUser, ToolCallID: tc.ID}`` for the same reason.
    Translated literally that becomes ``Message(role=USER,
    tool_call_id=...)``, and ``anthropic_provider.py:271-291`` branches
    on role alone: the message would encode as an ordinary text turn,
    ``tool_call_id`` would be dropped on the floor, and the unanswered
    ``tool_use`` block would still be unanswered — the exact API 400
    this function exists to prevent, now with the appearance of a fix.
    So the placeholder is a real ``Role.TOOL`` message.

    ``is_error`` stays ``False``: nothing failed. Marking it an error
    would teach the model to retry a call that already succeeded.

    **The role test is ``==``, not ``is``.** Decision Q11 spells it
    ``message.role == Role.TOOL`` and both adapters are written that way
    (``anthropic_provider.py:272,276,281``; ``openai_provider.py:140``
    converts with ``str()`` first). :class:`~omicsclaw.schema.Message` is
    a dataclass with no validation, so a history deserialized from a
    session row arrives with plain ``str`` roles, and
    :class:`~omicsclaw.schema.Role` is a ``StrEnum`` precisely so that
    keeps working. Under ``is`` it does not: every ``str`` role misses
    every branch, this function answers one ``tool_use`` with two
    ``tool_result`` messages, and the failure is silent.

    a function that rebuilds the conversation on every call would churn

    **``target_tokens`` is what "fits" means**, and it defaults to
    ``budget.usable_tokens``. The harness has the same two numbers and

    trims to ``contextWindow * 80/100`` (``compaction.go:86-92``) while
    the tiers that call it trigger from 60% of the same window
    (``progressive_compactor.go:129-133, 215``), so a fallback from
    ``TierFull`` genuinely removes messages. Collapse the two onto one
