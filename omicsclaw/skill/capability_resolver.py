"""Unified capability resolution for OmicsClaw chat and automation flows.

Determines whether a user request is:
- fully covered by an existing skill
- partially covered and needs custom post-processing
- not covered and should fall back to web-guided custom analysis

Scoring weights and decision thresholds are kept as module-level named
constants (see ``_SCORE_*`` / ``_DOMAIN_SCORE_*`` / ``_RESOLVE_*`` below).
Previous revisions buried those magic numbers inside arithmetic in
``_candidate_score`` and ``resolve_capability`` — OMI-12 P2.8 lifted them
out so future weight tuning is reviewable diff-by-diff, and the matching
golden routing snapshot (``tests/test_capability_resolver_golden.py``) flags
any silent re-ranking that slips through.
