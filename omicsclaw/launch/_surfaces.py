"""The three surfaces, started the same way: read flags, call a factory.

Plan 0037 §5.1, and the file that makes its judgement 3 ("三个面对称")
true rather than aspirational. Every function here has the same shape ——
parse this surface's half of the command line, hand the deployment half
to :func:`~omicsclaw.entry.resolve_app_config` unparsed, assemble, run,
close —— so that no facade is a process while the other two are
libraries.

**Nothing below is imported privately.** Only public names of
``omicsclaw.entry`` and its three public subpackages are used, which is
plan 0037 §5.1's rule for this file and is pinned by
``tests/launch/test_launch_is_above_entry.py``. The reverse arrow ——
``entry`` importing ``launch`` —— is what that probe exists to refuse.

**The environment arrives as an argument.** ``env`` is a
:class:`~typing.Mapping` handed down from :func:`omicsclaw.launch.main`,
which is the only module in this package that names the live process
environment at all —— this one never does. That is what lets a test
describe a whole deployment, credentials included, without touching the
process it runs in —— and it is why the channel credentials are read
here rather than in :mod:`omicsclaw.entry.channel`: **which** variables
name a Telegram bot is a property of a deployment, and a deployment is
what a process shell owns (plan 0037 §2 problem 1).

**Optional dependencies stay inside the function that needs them.**
``uvicorn``, ``fastapi`` and the seven adapter modules this file can
build are imported in plainly visible ``import`` syntax inside a factory,
never at module scope, so ``import omicsclaw.launch`` costs none of them
and a dependency scanner can still see them (plan 0031 trap 13). The
*platform* SDKs are not named here at all: an adapter module owns
its own SDK import —— lazily, inside the method that first needs a
client —— and which adapter module to load is resolved by
:func:`~omicsclaw.entry.channel.get_channel_class` through
:func:`importlib.import_module`, in ``entry`` where the registry lives
and not in this shell. What this file must do is turn the resulting
:exc:`ImportError`, which surfaces during start-up rather than at
import, into :exc:`MissingSurfaceDependency` rather than a traceback.

**A signal is part of being a process, so it is handled here.** The
channel surface is the one long-lived process of the three, and
``SIGTERM`` is how a container asks it to stop. :class:`_stop_signals`
turns both ``SIGTERM`` and ``SIGINT`` into an orderly shutdown of the
same shape and reports which one arrived, because ``128 + signum`` is
the only thing a supervisor can read. The CLI uses the same class for
``SIGTERM`` and ``SIGHUP``, and :class:`_interrupts` for ``SIGINT``.

    ``main.go:453-468`` with one of its three branches removed: a prompt
    means the harness's ``RunOnce`` (its third branch, the ``else``), no
    prompt means the interactive one. What is missing here is its
    *middle* branch, ``case term.IsTerminal(...)``, which starts a Bubble
    Tea TUI (``tui.go:17``); this repository has no TUI at all yet (plan
    0031 §1.3), Textual or otherwise.

    The deployment half is resolved **before** ``--help`` is answered,
    for the reason plan 0037 §5.2 gives: everything left of ``--`` goes
    to :func:`~omicsclaw.entry.resolve_app_config`, always, or a typo
    there is silently discarded by whichever surface flag happened to
    return first. The user still sees the usage, because
    :func:`omicsclaw.launch.main` prints it alongside the refusal.

    ``--configure`` is answered next, before anything is assembled: it
    exists to fix a deployment that cannot start, so making it pay for a
    start-up first would make it useless in the one case it is for.

    **This surface's flags are claimed from either half** (plan 0048).
    ``oc cli --configure`` used to be a usage error whose usage listed
    ``--configure``, because the flag was read on one side of ``--`` and
    the line was parsed from the other. :func:`_claim_surface_flags`
    takes them from the deployment half first, so both spellings mean
    the same thing. What is claimed is parsed *before* the half after
    ``--``, so the more explicit spelling wins when a flag is given
    twice.

    This is not an exception to the cut in
    :func:`~omicsclaw.launch._grammar.split_command_line` —— which is
    unchanged —— but a statement about ownership: the surface and
    deployment flag families are disjoint, so nothing here can take a
    flag ``resolve_app_config`` wanted.

    **One ordering property is genuinely weaker than before.** The
    surface half can now carry tokens from the left of ``--``, so a
    refusal about them reaches the user before an unknown *deployment*
    flag would have: ``oc cli --bogus x --session`` now names the
    missing session value rather than ``--bogus``. Both are refusals
    with the same exit code; what plan 0037 §5.2 forbids —— a typo on
    the deployment side being discarded by a surface flag that returns
    ``0`` first —— is still refused, and
    ``test_a_claimed_flag_cannot_turn_a_refusal_into_a_start`` pins it.

    Standard input is tested once, here. The answer chooses which of
    :func:`surface_config`'s CLI entry points this run is, and is what the
    REPL's prompt source is opened with.

    This is the whole of plan 0037's B1 and B2. Before it, ``SIGTERM``
    —— the signal a container, a systemd unit and ``kill`` all send by
    default —— had no handler at all, so the default disposition applied
    and the process died where it stood: no turn drained, no MCP child
    reaped, no sandbox container removed, even though
    :meth:`~omicsclaw.entry.assembly.AgentApp.aclose` documents a channel
    runner closing it on exactly that signal. ``SIGINT`` did run the
    cleanup, through :class:`asyncio.Runner`'s own handling, but
    :meth:`ChannelManager.run` absorbs the resulting
    :exc:`~asyncio.CancelledError` —— correctly, because "stopped" is not
    an error for a library —— so the coroutine returned normally and the
    shell reported ``0``. A supervisor reading ``0`` cannot tell "the
    operator stopped it" from "it finished".

    Handled here and not in :meth:`ChannelManager.run` deliberately. An
    exit code is a property of a process and this package is the process
    (plan 0037 §2 problem 1); a manager that re-raised would be encoding
    a shell's convention in a library that three other callers use, and
    it still could not report *which* signal arrived, which is the one
    fact ``128 + signum`` is made of.

    Installed through the loop rather than :func:`signal.signal` for the
    reason :class:`_interrupts` gives: the handler cancels a Task, and
    that is only safe on the loop's own thread (plan 0031 trap 10).

    Entered **before** the first adapter is built and not around the run
    loop alone, because the window between them is not theoretical: the
    first version of this class installed its handlers after
    :meth:`ChannelManager.start_all`, and the test that signals the
    process the moment it reports a channel serving killed it outright,
    every time. A start-up is exactly when a deployment is most likely
