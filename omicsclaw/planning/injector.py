"""Putting the plan back in front of the model, before every call.

Plan 0039 §2.2. This is the half of the planning system that makes the
other half worth having: a plan the model wrote four compactions ago is
only authoritative if it is still *present*, and the conversation is
exactly the place it will not be.

Two things are appended, in this order, and both only to the copy that is
sent:

1. the **planning gate** — one nudge, at most once per exchange, when the
   model has spent many turns of that exchange reading without writing a
   plan or touching anything;
2. the **plan block** — every outstanding item, verbatim, with a header
   saying it outranks whatever the history now says.

The order is the reference harness's (``loop_phases.go:201-216``) and it
is the useful one: the nudge only ever fires when there is no plan, so
the two never appear together, and if that ever changes the instruction
to make a plan should come before the plan it is asking for.

**Nothing here is persisted and nothing accumulates.** The engine appends
these to the conversation it sends and then discards them; the next call
recomputes from the store. That is what makes a plan edited by
``plan_write`` visible on the very next call with no invalidation
anywhere.

:class:`PlanInjector` satisfies
:class:`omicsclaw.engine.TurnAugmentor` **structurally**. It does not
import it, and a layering test pins that.

**Re-derived, not ported.** The reference harness uses 12, and says why
(``cmd/swebench/runner.go:52-55``): 12 is offset from its stall window of
10 and sits well below its SWE-bench median of 28 turns, so the nudge
lands while an exploration is drifting rather than after half the budget
is gone. Both of those numbers are properties of *its* run — an 80-turn
unattended coding budget.

The budget here is :attr:`~omicsclaw.engine.EngineConfig.max_turns` = 50,
derived in that module against this repository's own benchmark evidence.
The same fraction of the budget is 7.5, and 8 is the round number above
it. It is also comfortably longer than an ordinary omics question, which
converges in a handful of turns — a gate that fired inside those would be
teaching the model to plan a one-step task.

``0`` or less turns the gate off entirely and leaves the plan block,
which is the right setting for a surface that has its own idea of when to
interrupt.

Three properties are load-bearing and survive the translation: it states
the observation ("you have been reading and not doing"), it names the
tool, and it gives a three-part skeleton so that "make a plan" is a
concrete next action rather than an exhortation. The tool name is
interpolated rather than spelled, because a nudge naming a tool that is
not mounted is worse than no nudge.

as progress would disarm the gate for a model that is only exploring —
which is the behaviour the gate exists to catch.

Stated as a name set rather than read off :class:`ToolPolicy`'s
``writes_workspace`` claim, even though that would look more principled.
It would be wrong: ``writes_workspace`` is an advisory claim that
defaults to ``False`` (plan 0028), so an undeclared tool would read as

        Only the model turns of the current exchange are counted. The
        count runs from the end of *history* back to the nearest user
        message, which is the request that opened the exchange or the
        summary a compaction left in its place. Tool results are
        ``Role.TOOL`` messages and do not end it. A history with no user
        message is counted whole.

        Four conditions, and the first three are all ways of saying "this
        would be noise":

        - the gate is off, or has already fired this exchange;
        - a plan exists — a session with a plan is already being told
          about it every turn, so nudging it to make one is both wrong
          and confusing. This is the reference harness's *disarmed* flag
          (``loop_phases.go:255``) expressed as a fact about the store
          instead of as a flag, which means it also covers a plan
          restored from a previous session;
        - fewer than :attr:`_gate_turns` model turns of this exchange are
          visible — either the exchange has just started, or a compaction
          just replaced the ones that were. **The consequence is stated
          in plan 0039 §4.4 rather than fixed**: the reference harness
          counts in the engine, so its counter survives a compaction and
          can fire where this cannot. Accepted, because a compaction has
          just handed the model a fresh summary, and that is the one turn
          on which an extra instruction is least likely to help.

        The fourth is the actual test: none of the last :attr:`_gate_turns`
        assistant turns of this exchange called ``plan_write`` or a
        :data:`PROGRESS_TOOL_NAMES` tool. An assistant message is one
        turn whether or not it called a tool.

        That fourth condition is a **window**, where the reference
        harness's counter is permanent — a model that edited a file
        twenty turns ago and has read ever since is disarmed there and
        nudged here. The window is the better answer for this repository
        and it is a judgement, not an accident: an exploration that
        drifted after doing some work is the same drift, and the once
        per exchange guard is what stops the difference becoming
        repetition.
