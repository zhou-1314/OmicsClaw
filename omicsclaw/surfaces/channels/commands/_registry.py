"""Slash-command registry — replaces the ~250-line if-elif chain in
``bot/agent_loop.py:llm_tool_loop`` with a name → handler dispatch
table.

Phase 1 P0-E (Task #8). The previous chain had 14 ``elif cmd == ...``
branches inline; touching any of them required editing the same
function body, which made review noisy and adding a new command
("just one more elif") the path of least resistance.

The handlers live in ``bot/commands/builtins.py``. They register
themselves at import time via ``@register("/foo")``. The wirer in
``bot/agent_loop.py`` calls ``await dispatch(ctx)`` and treats
``None`` as "not a command — fall through to the LLM".
