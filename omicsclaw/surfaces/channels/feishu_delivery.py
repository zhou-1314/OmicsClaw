"""Single-attempt Feishu Adapter for persistent Outbound Delivery.

The Delivery Pump owns ordering and retry policy (ADR 0060/0063).  This Adapter
performs one ``im.v1.message.create`` call and classifies only the outcome of
that call; it never dispatches conversational work, sleeps, retries, chunks
text, edits a placeholder, or sends media.

The legacy ``FeishuChannel._send_text_sync`` did the opposite -- it retried
three times internally on transport errors -- which is unsafe here: a retried
send whose first attempt actually reached Feishu produces a duplicate reply
that the control plane cannot see or account for.  Transport ambiguity must
surface as ``ACCEPTANCE_UNKNOWN`` and let the Pump decide.
