"""One exchange: assemble its collaborators, run the loop, keep the result.

``AgentEngine.exchange`` renders a prompt, puts a history in front of it
and hands the finished trajectory back. This module is where all three of
those come from. Each turn hands the engine:

1. the app's prompt assembler, so an edited ``OMICSCLAW.md`` and
   today's date are both picked up — the engine renders
   it once, at the start of the exchange;
2. a :class:`_Carried`, this exchange's history and the place the engine
   leaves the conversation to carry forward;
3. a :class:`~omicsclaw.context.ProgressiveCompactor` that measures and,
   from the configured tier up, compacts the conversation before every
   model call of the run — and a
   :class:`~omicsclaw.planning.PlanInjector` that puts the session's
   outstanding plan back at the end of it afterwards, so that what
   compaction summarized away cannot take the plan with it.

:func:`_assemble` builds all of that in one place for all three paths
below (plan 0027 §12.4). The deadline stays out here: how long a
deployment is willing to wait is its own policy, not the loop's.

Each of the three paths below also wraps its exchange in
:meth:`~omicsclaw.observability.Telemetry.run` and feeds it the engine's
events. That is the whole of this layer's telemetry wiring: the scope
opens the interaction span, the events give it the turn boundaries, and
an unobserved deployment gets a scope whose spans are the shared no-op.
:mod:`omicsclaw.observability` explains why the engine was not given an
observer seam instead.

The history belongs to the caller. Nothing here is stored between calls
except what a caller chooses to carry: :class:`TurnOutcome` gives back
the conversation to keep and the compaction state to pass in next time.
