"""The composition root: five layers, wired once, by one function.

Plan 0031 task A. Every layer below this one names a hole in its own
docstring — ``engine/loop.py:34-38`` "the conversation arrives
assembled", ``context/__init__.py`` "``OMICSCLAW.md``, the model table and the
summarizing model are all the composition root's",
``tools/builtin/__init__.py`` "mounting a foundation tool is always a
decision about *which* workspace, and that decision belongs to whoever is
assembling the registry". They are five descriptions of this module.

:func:`build_app` is the only place that knows how the pieces fit. That
is the property worth defending: a second site that builds its own
registry or its own budget is a second deployment nobody configured.

**Three seams the assembly owns, each of which is silent when broken.**

*The two reserves have no defaults.*
:class:`~omicsclaw.context.ContextBudget` requires
``reserve_output_tokens`` and ``reserve_tool_tokens`` as positional
fields, and it requires them because nothing below can compute either:
the first comes from the model table in ``omicsclaw.provider``, the
second from the registry that was just built. See :func:`build_budget`.

*One workspace, six tools.* :func:`foundation_tools` constructs the
:class:`~omicsclaw.tools._workspace.Workspace` once and hands the same
object to every tool that takes one. Two workspaces would not raise —
they would give ``write_file`` and ``read_file`` two different sandbox
roots, and the agent would write a file it then cannot find.

*The registry goes to the engine unwrapped.*
:class:`~omicsclaw.tools.ToolRegistry` satisfies
:class:`~omicsclaw.engine.DeadlineAwareExecutor` and
:class:`~omicsclaw.engine.ConcurrencyAwareExecutor`, both
``runtime_checkable``, and the engine decides by :func:`isinstance`
whether to hand down a
:class:`~omicsclaw.tools.TimeoutPause`. Wrapping the registry for logging
or filtering without forwarding ``use_timeout_pause`` puts defect R3 back
in: a human's thinking time starts counting against the tool timeout
again, on the first layer that ever binds an approval channel. See
:func:`build_registry`.

**This layer is allowed to log, and is the first one that is.** The
logger is ``omicsclaw.entry``; nothing here configures it, so an
unconfigured process gets the root logger's default and warnings and
above are what reach a terminal. Two rules that are not style:
**no tool argument and no tool output is ever logged** — a ``bash``
command line, a ``write_file`` body and a ``web_fetch`` query string can
each carry a subject identifier, and :data:`SAFETY_RULES` rule 1 is
a rule a log statement can break — and no third-party logging library is
introduced.

**How the session registry gets here.** :func:`build_app` still returns
an app whose :attr:`AgentApp.sessions` is ``None``, and it always will:
the registry needs a finished app and the app names the registry, so
:func:`~omicsclaw.entry.session.attach_sessions` ties that knot in one
line with :func:`dataclasses.replace` rather than either object being
built twice. A deployment is therefore
``attach_sessions(await open_app(...))``, and an app that skipped that
call has no queues — :meth:`AgentApp.aclose` has nothing to drain and
``/chat/stream`` raises.

**Skills.** This module imports :mod:`omicsclaw.skills`:
:func:`foundation_tools` appends :func:`~omicsclaw.skills.use_skill_tool`
and :func:`default_sections` adds a skill catalogue section.
``AppConfig.skills_index`` is the switch, and ``off`` drops both. The
prompt is the contract, safety rules and tool guidance, then the
optional planning, execution sandbox and skills sections, the
environment, and the optional long-term memory block;
:func:`default_sections` documents when each optional one appears.

    look. ``web_fetch`` and ``web_search`` take none — their boundary is
    a destination, not a path — and that asymmetry is theirs, not an
    omission here.

    ``bash`` is constructed with :meth:`AppConfig.bash_timeout`, which is
    the derived half of the single timeout source. Its own
    ``max_timeout`` is that construction argument, so this call is what
    lets the model request the longer runs a deconvolution needs.

    it: the file tools share the workspace, which the sandbox mounts at
    the same path.

    *plans* mounts ``plan_write`` over one book; ``None`` leaves it out.

    at call time. It is mounted **after** ``use_skill`` and last overall,

    list a cached prompt prefix depends on (plan 0028).

    memory database; ``None`` leaves both out. They go after
    ``plan_write`` for the same byte-stability reason: a pair appended at
    the end costs a cached prefix nothing, a pair inserted in the middle
    moves every tool after it.

    ``ask_user`` is mounted after the memory pair when
    :attr:`AppConfig.ask_user` is on, and left out otherwise.

    *skill_env* gives ``use_skill`` its environment-check callback, which

    ``omicsclaw.context`` has no ``order`` field by ruling (plan 0030),
    so arrival order *is* render order and this tuple is where that order
    is decided.

    Planning sits directly after the tool guidance and before the two
    blocks that vary. It is static text about how to work, which is what
    the guidance above it is, and the ordering principle the skills
    section established is that the volatile blocks go last so an edited
    one invalidates as little of the cached prefix as possible.

    *plan_tool* says whether ``plan_write`` is actually mounted. It
    defaults to true because :func:`foundation_tools` mounts it whenever
    :attr:`~omicsclaw.entry.config.AppConfig.planning` is on, and a
    caller passing ``tools=`` to :func:`build_app` should pass ``False``
    unless it mounted one itself — a prompt instructing the model to use
    a tool that is not there costs turns on a capability the deployment
    does not have.

    **The catalogue section is absent with ``skills_index=off``.** Plan 0031 Q10 and
    §12-1 ruled the catalogue out of this step because this repository's
    skills were being redesigned; ``docs/plans/0032-skill-loader.md``
    landed after that and put it back. The reasoning behind the original
    ruling survives as the ``off`` switch: a model hunting for a skill
    that no longer exists is harder to diagnose than a model that was
    never told skills exist, so a deployment mid-migration turns the
    block off rather than shipping a stale directory.

    Pass *skills* to share one scan with :func:`foundation_tools`;
    ``None`` scans again.

    Pass *sandbox* to add an "Execution sandbox" section after the tool
    guidance, saying where ``bash`` runs — or that a requested sandbox is
    not running. A sandbox that is off adds nothing.

    Pass *memory* to add the long-term memory block, and note that it
    goes **after** the environment rather than before it. It is the most
    volatile block in the prompt — ``memory_write`` rewrites it
    mid-session, where the environment block only turns over at midnight
    — and the last block is the one whose edit invalidates the least of
    a cached prefix.

    A missing file yields ``""`` and takes its whole section with it
    (``text_from_file``), so a deployment with no ``OMICSCLAW.md`` beside
    its skill tree gets a prompt with no contract section.
    An empty skill index does the same. The safety, guidance and

    it. :func:`open_app` reads :meth:`AppConfig.mcp_config_path` and is the
    entry point a surface should call.

    ``tools=None`` mounts the six foundation tools on one workspace, plus
    ``use_skill`` unless ``skills_index=off``; ``sections=None`` builds
    the default prompt :func:`default_sections` describes. Both
    parameters exist so that three later things need no change here: a
    test can describe a whole app without touching the environment, a
    migration can add a tool by passing it, and a sub-agent is this same
    call with a narrower list.

    ``hooks=None`` takes the chain :func:`build_hooks` reads from the
    configuration, which is empty unless
    :attr:`~omicsclaw.entry.AppConfig.audit_log` is set; an explicit
    sequence replaces it, and ``()`` is how a caller says *no hooks even
    though the configuration asked for some*. The chain goes on **inside**
    the permission gate — see :mod:`omicsclaw.hooks` for the two
    consequences, of which the one to know is that a hook rewriting a
    tool's arguments is not re-judged by the gate.

    ``telemetry=None`` resolves one from the ``OTEL_*`` environment
    through :func:`~omicsclaw.observability.build_telemetry`, which is
    inactive unless ``OTEL_ENABLED=true``. Pass one to build a deployment
    that does not read the environment. An inactive
    :class:`~omicsclaw.observability.Telemetry` hands the provider back
    unwrapped and contributes no hook, so the object graph is exactly
    what it was before that layer existed.

    **``sessions`` is left ``None`` and stays that way.** The registry
    holds the app and the app names the registry, so it cannot be built
    here without building one of them twice;
    :func:`~omicsclaw.entry.session.attach_sessions` resolves that in one
    line afterwards and returns a *new* app. Do not replace the
    ``sessions=None`` below with a constructor — that is the mistake the
    circular reference is there to prevent.

    *provider* is the backend to use instead of
    :func:`~omicsclaw.provider.provider_from_env`. ``None`` builds one
    from the configuration and the environment. A provider passed here
    takes that one's place, so every consumer gets it: the telemetry
    wrapper, the summarizer, the sub-agent runner and the engine. The model name used for the context budget still comes
    from :func:`~omicsclaw.provider.resolve_config` over
    ``config.provider`` and ``config.model``, whatever *provider* is.
    This is how a test or an eval drives a whole deployment with a
    scripted backend.

    *skills* is the skill index to use instead of scanning again.

    **Starts no sandbox either.** *sandbox* is a binding from
    :func:`~omicsclaw.entry.sandbox.open_sandbox`; ``bash`` is built over
    its environment and the prompt says where ``bash`` runs. Without one,
    a configuration that asks for a sandbox is reported degraded — or
    refused with :exc:`~omicsclaw.sandbox.SandboxError` when
    ``sandbox_required`` is set. ``sandbox_auto_approve`` applies only to
    the ``bash`` built here, never to one passed in *tools*.

    **It does open the memory database**, unlike the two above, because
    opening a SQLite file needs no event loop and no process. The
    connection belongs to the returned app and is closed by
    :meth:`AgentApp.aclose`; a raise on the way out closes it here
    instead. What it does *not* do is the start-up maintenance that
    database wants — :func:`~omicsclaw.entry.memory.prepare_memory` is
    ``async`` and :func:`open_app` is what runs it.

    **before** the registry is built — so MCP tools are part of the tool
    snapshot and the context budget from the first turn, and the tool list
    does not change afterwards. ``${VAR}`` references in the file are
    expanded from the process environment.

    A server that fails to connect is logged and left out; the app still
    starts. A file that cannot be parsed raises
    :exc:`~omicsclaw.mcp.MCPConfigError`. Without a file this is exactly
    :func:`build_app`. *on_mcp_change* receives every status change while
    the servers connect.

    The sandbox :attr:`AppConfig.sandbox` asks for is started before the
    servers — see :func:`~omicsclaw.entry.sandbox.open_sandbox`; one that
    cannot start leaves ``bash`` on this machine, loudly, unless
    ``sandbox_required`` is set. *on_sandbox_change* receives every

    entries are deleted and ``MEMORY.md`` is rebuilt from what survives,
