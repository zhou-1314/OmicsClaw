"""``omicsclaw/entry`` — conversations, their queues, and one Task each.

Plan 0031 Q4 and Q6. The engine below deliberately has no ``Session``
("a conversation goes in, a conversation comes out"; plan 0027 declined
to build half of one), so a conversation's history has to live
somewhere, and this is the somewhere. The reference harness keeps it in
SQLite from line one (``main.go:232-245``); this module keeps it behind
a :class:`SessionStore` Protocol with one in-memory implementation,
because **building half a persistence layer is a mistake this rebuild
has already paid for once**.

**Two things live on a session, not one.** ``history`` is the obvious
one. :attr:`Session.compaction` is the one that goes missing:
``context/compaction.py:214-220`` says outright that
:class:`~omicsclaw.context.CompactionState` is "carried between turns by
the caller; step 6 decides where it lives", and a deployment that drops
it re-summarizes from ``FIRST_TEMPLATE`` every single time — paying for
a summary it already has and losing the detail the last one chose to
keep.

**The registry is three guarantees and nothing else** (Q6):

1. *One Task per exchange.* ``contextvars`` isolate per Task, so two
   concurrent sessions are isolated only if each runs in its own —
   otherwise "the second ``set`` wins and one user's tool call is offered
   to the other user's approval prompt" (``tools/context.py`` Q4.5).
2. *Serial within a session, concurrent across sessions.* A second
   message to one conversation waits; a message to another does not.
3. *Queueing is a semantic, not a lock* (Q7). :meth:`SessionRegistry.
   submit` returns a handle **immediately**, publishes how many
   exchanges are ahead of it, refuses outright past
   ``max_queued_per_session``, and a queued exchange can be cancelled
   before it ever starts. A ``submit`` that awaited a lock would give a
   user who typed twice no handle, no feedback and no way out.

**Persistence happens here, not in the exchange's Task** (trap 3b).
Cancelling a Task injects :exc:`asyncio.CancelledError` at its next
``await``, so ``finally: await store.save(...)`` does not finish — and
an in-memory store whose ``save`` never actually suspends hides that
until the day it becomes SQLite. So the registry, which is the side that
*asks* for cancellation, reaps the Task first and saves afterwards. For
the same reason :meth:`InMemorySessionStore.save` suspends once on
purpose.

**What is not here.** No authentication, no rate limiting, no durable
log, no cross-process anything. A sender allowlist is
:class:`~omicsclaw.entry.ingress.SenderPolicy`'s, one layer out, and it
is out there because a registry that decided who may talk to it would be
a registry every surface had to configure identically.

        Plan 0031 Q17. Three phases, in this order:

        1. refuse new submissions;
        2. wait up to *grace_s* for every lane to drain — the exchange
           running and whatever was already accepted behind it. Work that
           was admitted is finished if it can be; "graceful" is not a
           synonym for "abandon the queue";
        3. cancel what is left, running and queued alike, then wait once
           more for the pumps to persist what they can, and finally
           cancel and **reap** them.

        The worst case is therefore about ``2 × grace_s``: the grace the
        accepted work gets, and the same allowance again for the drain of
        what was cancelled — that second window is not the work, it is
        the ``await store.save`` that trap 3b insists happens out here.

        Reaping is not tidiness: an un-awaited cancelled Task prints
        "Task exception was never retrieved" at interpreter shutdown,
        into a log nobody is reading by then.

        :meth:`_close_out` runs from a ``finally`` and therefore on every
        exit, including the two early returns. It used to run only on the
        path that cancelled something, which meant a pump that had
        already died of its own exception left its handle unsettled and
        unrescued — the one case where the backstop was needed was the
        one case it was skipped.
