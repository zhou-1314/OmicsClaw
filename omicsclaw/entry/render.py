"""``omicsclaw/entry`` — one exchange's frames as text, and as JSON.

Plan 0031 §3.2. Two projections of :class:`~omicsclaw.entry.events.
TurnEvent`, deliberately of different kinds:

:class:`TextRenderer` is **stateful**, because the Channel Surface cannot
be served by a pure function. An IM platform rate-limits message edits, so
a bot that forwarded every text delta would be throttled within a
sentence; deltas have to be accumulated *across* events and sent in
batches. The CLI wants the opposite — a token on screen as it arrives —
so the same class does both, and which one is a constructor argument
rather than two classes with one shared bug.

:func:`to_wire` is **pure**, and is what crosses a process boundary.

Every text field a control line is built from — a tool name, a progress
message, a request id, a refusal's reason, a compaction's failure, an
error's type name, an approval card's reason and arguments — is made
inert by ``omicsclaw/entry/display.py`` before it is put in the line, so
no surface receives a control character from one. Text and reasoning
deltas are returned as they arrived; a surface that prints them makes
them inert itself.

Three things this module is careful about, each with a named trap in plan
0031 §6:

*The elapsed figure is not "how long the tool took"* (trap 6).
``EngineEvent.duration_s`` is wall-clock measured by the scheduler and
therefore **includes time a human spent deciding an approval**
(``engine/types.py:239-245``). The guard here is structural rather than
editorial: no field named for a tool's duration ever reaches a caller —
the text always carries :data:`ELAPSED_INCLUDES_APPROVAL_WAIT` and the
wire always uses ``elapsed_s`` plus an explicit
``elapsed_includes_approval_wait`` flag. Neither can be composed by
accident, and neither depends on anyone reading the prose.

*A missing token count and a zero token count are different facts*
(trap 7). ``usage=None`` only ever comes from a streamed run and means the
backend reported nothing; a zero :class:`~omicsclaw.schema.Usage` comes
from the blocking path and means "free **or** unreported", because
``Completion.usage`` cannot express the difference
(``engine/types.py:204-215``). They render as
:data:`USAGE_UNREPORTED` and :data:`USAGE_ZERO`, never as the same string.

*Tool arguments and tool output are not rendered as text* (Q22 rule 1),
approval lines excepted. Argument payloads and tool output can carry
subject identifiers, and this layer feeds a CLI, an IM transport and an
HTTP stream from one place, so :class:`TextRenderer` never puts a raw
payload or any output on a screen or in a chat; a Surface that has decided
it may show them reads them off
:attr:`~omicsclaw.entry.events.TurnEvent.engine` itself, having made that
decision explicitly. An approval line carries the request's reason and,
unless :attr:`~omicsclaw.tools.ApprovalRequest.reason_shows_call`, the
call's arguments with credential-named values hidden; both are made inert
by ``omicsclaw/entry/display.py``, shown to the person deciding, and never
logged.

:func:`to_wire` is the other case and the opposite rule: it **must**
carry both, because ``ToolCall.arguments`` crossing byte for byte is a
published contract (see below) and a ``tool_result`` without its content
is not a result. It follows that ``to_wire``'s **output** is itself
inside Q22 rule 1's protection: those dictionaries reach an SSE stream by
way of ``desktop/turn_observation.py``, whose ``_wire_json_value``
redacts by *key name* only and passes every string through untouched. A
frame is therefore not safe to log, and nothing here logs one.

**Wire compatibility** (Q24). ``POST /chat/stream`` is a published
contract with an external client, not this layer's to invent. Three
consequences are load-bearing and are pinned by tests:

- ``ToolCall.arguments`` crosses **byte for byte**. It is a raw JSON
  string precisely so that a decode/re-encode cannot reorder keys
  (``schema/message.py:81-89``); prompt-prefix caching and replay
  evidence both depend on those bytes.
- A ``tool_result`` frame uses the key names
  ``surfaces/desktop/_chat_sse.py`` reads — ``tool_use_id``,
  ``tool_name``, ``content``, ``is_error``. That renderer's 4 MiB
  oversize projection reaches into the payload by name, so a frame that
  spelled them differently would lose its correlation identity exactly
  when a result is too big to send.
- The terminal frame preserves the error's **type**
  (``wire_contract.py``: ``terminal_error_type_preserved``), and only its
  type: an exception's text can contain a URL with credentials in the
  query string.

The mapping from :class:`~omicsclaw.entry.events.TurnEventType` to that
client's frame names is :data:`DESKTOP_CHAT_FRAME_TYPE`; ``to_wire``
itself tags frames with the enum value, because the enum is this layer's
truth and the client's vocabulary is the Desktop Surface's to speak.
