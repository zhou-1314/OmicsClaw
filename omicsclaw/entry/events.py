"""``omicsclaw/entry`` — what one user exchange emits, with an identity.

Plan 0031, step 6 of the staged framework rebuild. Step 3
(:mod:`omicsclaw.engine`) already emits :class:`~omicsclaw.engine.types.
EngineEvent`; this module is its **superset**, and the superset exists for
three reasons that are all structural rather than stylistic:

``APPROVAL_REQUIRED`` / ``APPROVAL_SETTLED``
    The engine has no representation for "a human is being asked". It
    cannot grow one honestly either: the ``await`` that waits for a person
    happens *inside* a tool, inside the engine generator's ``__anext__``,
    so the generator that would have to report the question is the same
    generator that is blocked on its answer. The layer that binds
    ``ApprovalChannel`` is this one, so the layer that can say so is this
    one (plan 0031 Q5).

``CONTEXT`` / ``COMPACTION``
    Both come from the compactor the engine consults before each model
    call, not from the engine: the engine does not know what a budget or
    a compaction record is. They are published by the exchange that
    supplied the compactor, so they reach the stream ahead of that model
    call's own events.

``QUEUED`` / ``GAP`` / ``EXCHANGE_*``
    Facts about *delivery*, not about the loop: a second message arriving
    while the first is still running, an observer whose cursor fell off
    the ring, and the boundary of one user round-trip.

**Two scopes, deliberately not the same word** (Q21)
------------------------------------------------------

``TURN_END`` is the engine's, and it fires **once per model call** — the
emit site is ``engine/loop.py:287``, inside the ``while`` that starts at
``:234``, so one user round-trip produces *N* of them, one per
Thought→Action→Observation cycle.

``EXCHANGE_START`` / ``EXCHANGE_END`` are this layer's, and they fire
**once per user round-trip** — exactly one each, whatever happened in
between. Pairing a new ``*_START`` with the engine's ``TURN_END`` would
have mismatched their cardinality, which is the drafting error Q21
records.

**Pass-through events carry the original** :class:`EngineEvent`, on
:attr:`TurnEvent.engine`, never a re-packed copy. Re-packing would create
a second place that has to change every time the engine's event grows a
field, and the first place would keep compiling while the second silently
dropped it.

This module is types only: no I/O, no clock, no logging. Transport lives
in :mod:`omicsclaw.entry.stream` and projection in
:mod:`omicsclaw.entry.render`.
