"""The channel surface's composition root: bindings in, exchanges out.

Plan 0031 task D1. Every shipped adapter in this package was written against
one object — a runtime it is handed, submits normalised inbound messages to,
and never composes itself. That object used to be ``ControlRuntime``. This is
the half of it that belongs to :mod:`omicsclaw.entry` (plan 0031 Q23,
family ①): *who gets in*, *one exchange per message*, *the reply out*.

**What deliberately did not come across.** ``ControlRuntimePorts`` carried
twenty-two per-turn fields, six of them :data:`~typing.Any`. Here one exchange
is an :class:`~omicsclaw.entry.ingress.InboundMessage` and nothing else: the
model, the output style and the MCP list are deployment facts on
:class:`~omicsclaw.entry.config.AppConfig`, and the rest do not exist yet. The
durable half — outbox ordering, receipts, replay — is not in this step either
(plan 0031 §11); a reply here lives exactly as long as the process.

**Three obligations this file carries alone**, because nothing below it can:

1. *Refuse first.* :meth:`ChannelRuntime.submit` consults
   :class:`~omicsclaw.entry.ingress.SenderPolicy` **before** it touches
   :class:`~omicsclaw.entry.session.SessionRegistry`, so a message from
   outside the allowlist creates no exchange at all — not an exchange that
   answers "no". Authoritative ingress admits nobody else.
2. *Close the observation.* ``TurnStream.observer_count()`` does not decrease
   when an ``async for`` breaks, so the grace period that abandons an unwatched
   exchange can only start if this file calls ``aclose()``. Every observation
   opened here is opened with ``async with``.
3. *Hop to the loop.* Several vendor SDKs deliver callbacks on their own
   threads. ``ApprovalBroker.settle`` resolves an :class:`asyncio.Future` and
   is only safe on the loop's thread, so
   :meth:`ChannelRuntime.settle_approval_threadsafe` is the
   ``call_soon_threadsafe`` hop spelled out and is the only settle a callback
   should use (plan 0031 trap 10).

cancelled mid-flight is exactly the

"""Frames worth interrupting a chat for **while an exchange is running**.

Anything the person has to act on, and anything that changes what they should
believe about what they are seeing. The answer itself is not here, and that is
the decision this constant exists to record:

*The answer is delivered once, from the trajectory, after the exchange ends.*
Three reasons, and the second is a property of this layer rather than a
preference:

1. Every platform here rate-limits sends and edits. A message per token stops
   a bot inside its first sentence.
2. **Delta frames are droppable by contract** (plan 0031 Q14): an observation
   buffers 64 frames, and a backend that yields a hundred chunks without
   awaiting fills that buffer before this pump is ever scheduled. The dropped
   deltas are announced by a ``GAP``, which is honest and is *still a
   truncated answer*. The exchange's own trajectory has no gaps.
3. It is what the adapters did **before** the port —
   ``surfaces/channels/feishu.py:558-560`` reads word for word: this handler
   "performs no LLM work, sends no placeholder, and produces no reply: the
   terminal reply is committed with the Turn and delivered by the persistent
   Delivery Pump". ``entry/channel/feishu.py:605-608`` says the same thing
   in its own words, and adds the one difference — this pump holds the reply
   in memory rather than in a durable outbox.

``TOOL_START``, ``TOOL_RESULT``, ``PROGRESS``, ``TURN_END``, ``CONTEXT`` and
``COMPACTION`` are absent for the first reason alone. ``GAP`` is absent
because, with the answer taken from the trajectory, a gap is a fact about a
buffer and no longer a fact about what the person is reading.

This is surface policy, not a renderer limitation: a deployment that wants the
tool trace, or a live token stream, passes its own set —
:meth:`ChannelRuntime._pump_reply` batches deltas and suppresses the
after-the-fact answer when it has already streamed one. ``REASONING_DELTA``
would still do nothing: :class:`~omicsclaw.entry.render.TextRenderer`
suppresses it unless ``show_reasoning`` is set.

        card, a terminal frame that is not a success. These are control

        assistant message with text in that span, whichever turn of the

        and no answer is sent for it.

        An emergency truncation can drop the request and leave no summary.
        The search then runs past where the request was. It stops at an
        older user message, or at a summary written later in the same
