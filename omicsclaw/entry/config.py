"""``omicsclaw.entry`` — the one place a deployment is read.

Plan 0031 task A, decision Q8. Every layer below this one was built to
know nothing about its environment: ``EngineConfig`` reads no variables
on purpose (plan 0027: "a turn ceiling that moves with the shell makes
two runs of one benchmark incomparable"), ``omicsclaw.context`` takes
the contract file and the model table as callables and integers, and
``omicsclaw.tools`` takes a :class:`~omicsclaw.tools._workspace.Workspace`
rather than finding one. All of that knowledge arrives here.

**One parse point, and it fetches one thing.**
:func:`resolve_app_config` is the only place a deployment is
interpreted, but as of plan 0037 §5.4 it no longer *fetches* anything:
the command line and the process environment are handed to it by
:func:`omicsclaw.launch.main`, which is the only reader of those two
globals in the program. This module therefore takes no interest in the
process it runs in, and the rule over this package is now flat — no
module under ``omicsclaw/entry/`` names either global, with no
exemption list. The one declared exception to the whole arrangement
survives from plan 0031 Q8 and lives a layer down:
:func:`omicsclaw.provider.provider_from_env` keeps reading its own API
key, because moving a secret through this dataclass would only add a
place it can be printed from. Everything else — which workspace, which
model, how long a tool may run — is a field below.

**The timeout is one number, written once.** ``tool_timeout_s`` is the
single source for both halves of the ceiling a tool runs under:
:meth:`AppConfig.engine_config` derives the scheduler's
``EngineConfig.tool_timeout`` and :meth:`AppConfig.bash_timeout` derives
what ``bash`` is constructed with, one
:data:`~omicsclaw.tools.builtin.bash.ENGINE_TIMEOUT_MARGIN` below it.
Plan 0031 §12-2 is blunt about why two independent literals are not
acceptable: the day somebody raises the ceiling they will raise one of
them, and half of this mechanism does not help. The margin is imported
rather than re-typed for the same reason.

**Bad input is refused, not defaulted.** ``omicsclaw/provider/config.py``
replaces an unparseable environment value with its default; this module
raises :exc:`AppConfigError` instead. The divergence is deliberate and
narrow: a provider setting that silently falls back costs one slow
request, while ``OMICSCLAW_TOOL_TIMEOUT_S=6OO`` silently falling back to
60 s is exactly the failure §12-2 exists to prevent, and a single parse
point is the only place that can say so out loud.

**What this module does not read.** No ``.env`` file, and that is no
longer a gap. The reference harness loads ``cwd/.env``
(``main.go:117``) and this repository's ``.env.example`` documents ``.env``
as the way channel credentials are supplied, but a resolver that returns
a value cannot make ``provider_from_env`` see a variable without
mutating the live environment behind its caller's back. Loading it
belongs to whatever owns the process, and since plan 0037's review
:func:`omicsclaw.launch._adopt_dotenv` does it — before this function
is called, without overriding anything already exported. Between the
delivery and the review the promise was recorded in three places and
implemented in none, which is the failure mode "recorded as open" has
when nobody is counting.

``os`` is still imported, for :data:`os.pathsep` in :func:`_as_paths`
and nothing else. Plan 0037 §5.4 predicted the import would go with the
default; separator-joined path lists are the reason it does not.

    function pure anyway.** :attr:`AppConfig.workspace` falls back to
    :meth:`Path.cwd` below — the harness's ``os.Getwd()`` at
    ``main.go:112``, which that harness reads in its *process shell* and
    this one reads here. It is the same class of dependency as the two
    that were lifted out, and it survived because nothing scanned for
    it: the rule over this package names two globals and the working
    directory is a third. Left in place rather than promoted to a third
    parameter, because every caller would then have to supply a value
    they have no opinion about; recorded so that "pure" is not claimed
    for something that reads the process it runs in. The result is
    resolved to an absolute path here, so every tool below sees one
    spelling of it.

    Raises :exc:`AppConfigError` for an unparseable value, an unknown
    flag, or an override that is not a field of :class:`AppConfig`.
