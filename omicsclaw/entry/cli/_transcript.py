"""Tool calls as they read in the terminal transcript, after the fact.

Turns one ``TOOL_START`` or ``TOOL_RESULT`` frame into the lines a
terminal prints for it: the neutral head line it is handed, a call
number, the call's arguments and a bounded preview of its output.
Every other frame comes back as the single line it arrived as, except a
question card, which comes back line by line in the normal style.

Behaviour that decides how this is called:

- a result is paired to its call through ``ToolResult.tool_call_id``, so
  the number is right even when two calls to one tool finish in the
  other order; a result whose call is unknown is left unnumbered rather
  than given a number that would be wrong;
- ``detail=False`` keeps arguments and output off the screen entirely,
  leaving only the head and the number, for a deployment that must not
  put payload in a scrollback;
- tools in :data:`_RENDERED_ELSEWHERE` never show either, because the
  surface prints their payload itself;
- every line is made inert by
  :func:`~omicsclaw.entry.display.inert_line` before it is shown, the
  head included, and a multi-line head (an approval card) by
  :func:`~omicsclaw.entry.display.inert_prose`: a tool's output can carry
  ANSI, and a terminal executes what it is sent;
- in arguments that decode as JSON, the value under every credential-named
  key is hidden by :func:`~omicsclaw.tools.preview.redact_credentials`;
- arguments that do not are shown only as their length, by
  :func:`~omicsclaw.entry.display.unreadable_arguments_note`, as on the
  approval card, and nothing here raises on any input.

Every line returned is a :class:`~rich.text.Text`, so a bracket in an
argument or in output is never read as rich markup.
