"""Where a line of input comes from — which is a parameter, not a fact.

The reference harness's CLI is ``runCLI(ctx, eng, io.Reader, idx)``
(``cli.go:36``): the reader is an argument, so the loop can be driven by a
test without a terminal. This module is that argument. :class:`Repl
<omicsclaw.entry.cli._repl.Repl>` never touches :data:`sys.stdin` and
never imports ``prompt_toolkit``; it asks a :class:`PromptSource` for the
next line and is told when there are no more.

Three implementations, in the order a deployment prefers them:

:class:`PromptToolkitSource` — history, completion, a styled prompt. Built
by :func:`open_prompt_source` **only** when standard input is a terminal
and the package is installed.

:class:`StreamSource` — ``readline`` on any text stream. What a pipe gets,
and what ``oc cli < script.txt`` gets. The read happens on a daemon
thread of its own, so that a blocking ``readline`` stops neither the
event loop the session registry's lanes live on nor that loop's
shutdown.

:class:`ScriptedSource` — a fixed list, for tests and for
``--prompt-file``.

**A source is read from more than one task at a time.** :class:`Repl
<omicsclaw.entry.cli._repl.Repl>` answers each approval request from its
own Task so that the event pump never stops consuming, and one model
message may carry two calls to concurrency-safe tools that both ask —
``web_fetch`` and ``web_search`` are exactly that pair. Concurrent
:meth:`PromptSource.read` is therefore part of the contract, and a source
backed by **one** device has to queue its readers rather than let them
collide: ``prompt_toolkit`` asserts ``Application is already running`` on
the second overlapping prompt, and two ``readline`` threads on one stdin
hand the same typed line to whichever wakes first.

**Nothing here is imported at module scope that is not installed
everywhere** (plan 0031 trap 13). ``prompt_toolkit`` is imported inside
:func:`open_prompt_source` in plainly visible ``import`` syntax — not
through :func:`importlib.import_module`, which is the form plan 0028's
handover records as the one a static check cannot see — and the fallback
to :class:`StreamSource` is what makes the package usable without it.
