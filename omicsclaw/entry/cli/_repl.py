"""The loop: read a line, run an exchange, print what it says.

Plan 0031 task D3. The reference harness's whole CLI is
``runCLI(ctx, eng, io.Reader, idx)`` with three exits — context done, EOF,
``exit``/``quit`` (``cli.go:36-79``) — and this is the same loop against
:class:`~omicsclaw.entry.session.SessionRegistry` instead of an engine,
which buys three things a direct ``engine.run`` could not have: the
exchange has an identity that survives the iterator, a second ``Ctrl-C``
has something to cancel, and an approval can be answered while the stream
is still being consumed.

**The input is an argument** (:class:`~omicsclaw.entry.cli._input.
PromptSource`). Nothing here reads :data:`sys.stdin`, so the loop under
test is the loop that ships — the one thing ``cli.go`` does that is worth
copying exactly.

**``Ctrl-C`` cancels the exchange, not the process.**
:meth:`Repl.interrupt` cancels the running handle; the registry publishes
``EXCHANGE_END(terminal="cancelled")``, this loop prints it and asks for
the next line. Two consequences are load-bearing and are tested:

- the conversation is **byte-identical** afterwards (plan 0031 trap 3).
  The engine's trajectory exists only on its ``DONE`` event, so a
  cancelled exchange has nothing partial to keep that would not be a
  guess, and this file does not invent one — it does not touch
  ``session.history`` at all;
- the loop continues. A REPL that died on the interrupt would make
  cancelling a runaway tool call cost the conversation.

**Approvals are answered from a separate Task** (trap 1). The harness
writes it as a consumer contract — "the UI must keep consuming events
while it shows the dialog" (``stream.go:51-58``) — and in Python it is
harder than that: awaiting a human inside the ``async for`` body stops the
iteration that would deliver the *second* tool's approval request, and two
concurrent tools then deadlock. So :meth:`Repl._ask` runs beside the pump
and the pump never waits for a person.

Two requests in flight are therefore two Tasks, but they share one
terminal, and queueing them on it belongs to the source
(:class:`~omicsclaw.entry.cli._input.PromptToolkitSource`) rather than
here — the pump must keep running either way. What this file owes in
return is that **a question that cannot be put is still answered**:
:meth:`Repl._ask` denies on any failure, because this surface sets no
approval deadline and an unsettled request is an exchange that never
ends.

**A question from ``ask_user`` is read the same way.** The pump prints
the card and starts a Task (:meth:`Repl._ask_question`) that reads one
line at an ``answer [#n]> `` prompt. The line is the answer, whatever it
is: an empty one skips the question and Ctrl-C cancels the exchange.

**A card takes only what is typed after its prompt opens.** A terminal
keeps what is typed while nothing reads it, so a ``y`` typed while a tool
ran, or the late reply to a question whose prompt was taken down, would
otherwise answer the next card to open. :meth:`Repl._read_at_card` asks
the source for a fresh line and says so on screen when input was thrown
away. The loop's own prompt reads whatever is waiting, as before: a line
typed while an answer was printing is the next message.

**What this loop does not do.** Part of the ported catalogue (see
:data:`~omicsclaw.entry.cli._slash_command_support.REPL_SLASH_COMMAND_SPECS`),
because the skill runner, the research pipeline and the memory commands
are each a step of their own. A user who types one of those is told it
is not in this build rather than being left to wonder.

**Planning is visible here and not drivable.** ``/plan`` and ``/tasks``
read :attr:`~omicsclaw.entry.assembly.AgentApp.plans` and print it;
there is no ``/approve-plan`` and no "do the next task" because
:mod:`omicsclaw.planning`'s model is that the agent decides when a job
is worth planning, and a control panel bolted to the side of that would
be a second, contradictory answer to the same question. The three
commands are refused like any other unimplemented name, and the line
printed here is the whole of what this surface has to say about them.

**Visible is not the same as pull-only, though.** ``/plan`` alone made
the plan a thing a person had to *suspect had changed* before they could
see that it had, which is the one job a plan cannot do. So a successful
``plan_write`` also pushes the new snapshot into the transcript
(:meth:`Repl._show_plan`) — the reference harness appends its block on
the same trigger, ``toolName == "plan_write" && !result.IsError``
(``tui_update.go:641-646`` into ``updatePlanBlock``, ``:1637-1649``).

One departure: that append is unconditional, so a ``plan_write`` called
in *read* mode — which the tool supports and a model uses to re-read
what it was refused — leaves a second identical copy in the transcript.
Here the snapshot is compared with the last one printed and a plan that
did not move prints nothing. It stays read-only either way: this shows
what the tool already accepted and has no way to write one.

**And the silences are narrated.** Between ``TOOL_START`` and
``TOOL_RESULT`` — or between a question and the first token of its
answer — no frame arrives for as long as the work takes, and this loop
used to spend that time printing nothing at all. :class:`~omicsclaw.
entry.cli._activity.ActivityLine` runs beside the pump and says what is
outstanding and for how long. Who may own the cursor while it does, and
why a pipe gets appended lines instead of an animation, is that module's
docstring; what this file owes it is the state changes (a tool started,
a tool reported, a tool finished) and a :meth:`ActivityLine.hold` around
every stretch where something else is writing.

**A line starting with ``!`` never reaches the model.**
:meth:`Repl._dispatch` takes it before the command catalogue is
consulted and :mod:`~omicsclaw.entry.cli._shell` runs it; what it
printed is prefixed to the *next* question and then dropped. ``Ctrl-C``
while it runs kills it and gives the prompt back. That module
is where the reasoning about timeouts, ceilings and the absent approval
gate lives.
