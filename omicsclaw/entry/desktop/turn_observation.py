"""The ``/chat/stream`` SSE body: turn events projected onto Desktop frames.

Each frame is one ``data:`` line carrying a JSON object with exactly two
keys, ``type`` and ``data``, followed by a blank line. ``data`` is a
string: plain text for ``text``, ``thinking``, ``tool_output`` and the
terminal frames, and a JSON-encoded object for the rest.
:func:`~omicsclaw.entry.desktop._chat_sse.render_chat_sse_frame` keeps
every frame under 4 MiB.

A frame an event produced is preceded by an ``id:`` line holding that
event's sequence number, which is a resume cursor: a client that has
received ``id: N`` has every frame of the events numbered up to N, and a
``/chat/stream`` request with ``after_seq: N`` continues after them. The
frames that end the stream (a ``/compact`` exchange's reported
``status``, ``result``, ``error``, ``done``), the ``error`` and ``done``
a body adds when its observation ends early, and ``keep_alive`` carry no
``id:`` line. A client holds the frames without one until ``done``
arrives, and drops them if the connection breaks first, because a
resumed stream sends them again.

The frames of ``sse_schema_version`` 3:

* ``text`` / ``thinking`` — an answer delta / a reasoning delta.
* ``tool_use`` — ``tool_use_id``, ``tool_name``, ``arguments`` (the call's
  raw JSON string, byte for byte), ``turn``, and the identity keys.
* ``tool_result`` — ``tool_use_id``, ``tool_name``, ``content``,
  ``is_error``, ``elapsed_s`` (which includes any approval wait),
  ``elapsed_includes_approval_wait``, ``turn``, and the identity keys.
* ``tool_output`` — a tool's progress message.
* ``status`` — a compaction: ``kind`` is ``"compaction"``, with the
  before/after counts, ``degraded``, ``written_back`` and the identity
  keys. A ``/compact`` exchange always sends one, including when nothing
  was compacted (``written_back`` false).
* ``permission_request`` — ``request_id``, ``tool_name``, ``arguments``,
  ``reason``, ``reason_shows_call``, ``risk_level``, ``approval_mode``,
  ``ask_every_time``, ``can_remember`` (whether "always allow" can take
  effect for this call) and the identity keys. Sent only while the
  request is outstanding; a request a session grant or ``full_access``
  answers is allowed without a card.
* ``event_omitted`` — frames were lost to this cursor, or one frame was
  too large to send. Its ``id:`` is the sequence number just before the
  first event still available, or the oversized event's own.
* ``result`` — once, before ``done``, when the exchange converged:
  ``usage`` (the key-wise sum of every model call's ``input_tokens``,
  ``output_tokens``, ``cache_read_tokens`` and ``cache_write_tokens`` in
  the exchange, as read by this body and any earlier one over the same
  exchange, or ``null`` if none reported usage), ``usage_reported``
  (every call reported usage and no call can have gone unread),
  ``model_calls``, ``provider`` and ``model``.
* ``keep_alive`` — after :data:`KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL_S` of silence.
* ``error`` then ``done`` — the exchange was cancelled (``"cancelled"``) or
  failed (the exception's type name only); ``done`` alone — it converged.

The identity keys are ``sequence``, ``turn_id`` and ``session_id``.
