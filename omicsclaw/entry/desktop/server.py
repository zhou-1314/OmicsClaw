"""The Desktop HTTP routes, and the plain functions behind them.

Routes (see :data:`~omicsclaw.entry.desktop.wire_contract.SERVED_PATHS`):

* ``POST /chat/stream`` — admit one chat message and stream its frames;
* ``POST /chat/permission`` — answer one ``permission_request``;
* ``POST /chat/abort`` — cancel the exchange a stream request started;
* ``POST /chat/session-permission-profile`` — put a session in the
  ``default`` or ``full_access`` permission profile;
* ``GET /workspace`` — the workspace this process serves;
* ``PUT /workspace`` — accepted only for that same workspace, since a
  process serves one workspace and changing it means a restart;
* ``GET /env/doctor`` — a checklist of what this backend was assembled
  with (:mod:`~omicsclaw.entry.desktop.doctor`);
* ``GET``/``HEAD /health`` — process facts and the wire contract;
* ``GET /skills`` and ``GET /skills/{domain}/{name}`` — the skill index
  (:mod:`~omicsclaw.entry.desktop.catalog`);
* ``GET /mcp/servers`` — the MCP servers and their connection state
  (:mod:`~omicsclaw.entry.desktop.catalog`);
* ``GET``/``PUT /providers`` and ``POST /providers/test`` — the model
  backend the deployment's ``.env`` configures
  (:mod:`~omicsclaw.entry.desktop.providers`);
* ``POST /chat/title`` — a title for a session's first message
  (:mod:`~omicsclaw.entry.desktop.title`);
* ``GET /files/tree`` and ``GET /files/serve`` — read-only views of the
  workspace's files (:mod:`~omicsclaw.entry.desktop.files`).

A ``/chat/stream`` message whose content is exactly ``/compact`` compacts
the session's history instead of being sent to the model. A
``/chat/stream`` body with ``resume: true`` reattaches to the exchange
its ``source_request_id`` started and never starts one.

Every write route requires ``Content-Type: application/json`` and answers
415 ``unsupported_media_type`` otherwise, including when the header is
missing. A cross-origin page can send a ``text/plain`` request to a
loopback port without a CORS preflight, but not a JSON one, and this
server grants no CORS. A refused request is answered as
``{"detail": <code>}`` with the code's status.

Everything above the HTTP boundary — :func:`open_chat_stream`,
:func:`health_payload`, :func:`workspace_payload`,
:func:`change_workspace`, the functions in
:mod:`~omicsclaw.entry.desktop.interactions` and
:func:`~omicsclaw.entry.desktop.doctor.doctor_report` — is plain ``async def`` or
``def`` over plain dictionaries. :func:`create_desktop_app` is the adapter
that puts them behind FastAPI, and it imports FastAPI **inside the
function body**, so ``import omicsclaw.entry.desktop`` succeeds where no
web framework is installed.

This module does **not** enable ``from __future__ import annotations``.
The routes are defined inside :func:`create_desktop_app`, where
``Request`` is a local name; with postponed evaluation FastAPI would see
the string ``"Request"``, fail to resolve it in this module's globals and
treat the parameter as a required query parameter, so every route would
answer 422.
