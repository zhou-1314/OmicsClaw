description: Load when summarising a phased VCF (output of WhatsHap / SHAPEIT5 / Eagle2) — phased fraction
  of het variants, phase-block N50, PS-field parsing, pipe-delimited genotype detection. Skip when the
  input is unphased (run a phaser first); calling small variants (use genomics-variant-calling).

# genomics-phasing

## When to use

The user has a phased VCF (from WhatsHap, SHAPEIT5, Eagle2, etc.)
and wants phasing QC: total het count, phased fraction, phase-block
count, phase-block N50 (in bp), per-block sizes. Phasing detection
relies on the `PS` (Phase Set) FORMAT field plus pipe-delimited
genotype encoding (`0|1` vs `0/1`).

This skill does NOT phase variants — it summarises a VCF that has
already been phased.

## Inputs & Outputs

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED from skill.yaml (interface) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: python scripts/generate_skill_md.py <skill_dir> -->

**Inputs**

- File types: `.vcf`
- Accepts artifact `genomics.filtered_variants` (`vcf`)

**Outputs**

- `tables/phase_blocks.csv`
- `tables/phased_variants.csv`
- `report.md`
- `result.json`
- Produces artifact `genomics.phased_variants` as `tables/phased_variants.csv` (`csv`)

## Flow

1. Load VCF (`--input <phased.vcf>`) or generate a demo phased VCF at `output_dir/demo_phased.vcf` with `--n-variants` records (`genomics_phasing.py:200`).
2. Parse records; classify each het as phased (`|` in GT and `PS` populated) or unphased (`/`).
3. Group phased variants by `PS`; compute per-block start / end / length / variant count.
4. Compute phase-block N50 (bp); phased fraction across all hets.
5. Write `tables/phased_variants.csv` (`genomics_phasing.py:327`) + `tables/phase_blocks.csv` (`:345`) + `report.md` + `result.json` (`:348`).

## Gotchas

- **No phaser is invoked.** This skill ingests an already-phased VCF — it does not run WhatsHap / SHAPEIT5 / Eagle2. Run a phaser upstream and feed its VCF here.
- **`--input` REQUIRED unless `--demo`.** `genomics_phasing.py:314` raises `ValueError("--input required when not using --demo")`; non-existent paths raise `FileNotFoundError` at `:317`.
- **Unphased VCFs produce empty phase-block tables.** A VCF without any `|` genotypes or `PS` fields will report `phased_fraction = 0` and an empty `phase_blocks.csv` — but the run does NOT fail. Always check the summary before drawing conclusions.
- **`PS` is required for block grouping — without it you get ZERO blocks.** When `PS` is absent, `genomics_phasing.py:126` falls back to `str(pos)` so every variant becomes a singleton phase-set; then `:157` filters out blocks with `< 2` variants, producing zero phase blocks and `phase_block_n50_bp = 0`. WhatsHap output always includes `PS`; some other phasers do not — verify before interpreting an "unphased" report.
- **Multi-sample VCFs are NOT supported.** Only the first sample column is parsed; multi-sample phasing comparison is out of scope.
- **Demo VCF synthesises ~80% phased het variants in 5–20 blocks.** Useful for orchestrator smoke tests; not biologically meaningful.

## Key CLI

```bash
# Demo (2000 synthetic phased variants)
python omicsclaw.py run genomics-phasing --demo --output /tmp/phase_demo

# Real WhatsHap-phased VCF
python omicsclaw.py run genomics-phasing \
  --input sample.whatshap.vcf --output results/
```
