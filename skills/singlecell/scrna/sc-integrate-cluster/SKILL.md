# sc-integrate-cluster

**Domain:** Single-Cell Omics (scRNA) · **Role:** consensus member skill

## When to use

One self-contained *integrate + cluster* unit, used as a fan-out member of
`sc-consensus-integration` (ADR 0016 / 0029). It produces a batch-correction
representation **and** clusters on it at a fixed resolution, emitting the standard
`sc-clustering` artifact schema so the consensus `ScClusteringArtifactReader`
reads it unchanged. You normally do **not** call this directly — the consensus
planner fans it out across methods. Input is a preprocessed AnnData with an `obs`
batch key (≥2 batches for any real integration method); an `X_pca` baseline is
computed if absent.

This is the single-cell analog of `spatial-domains --method <m>`: the integration
consensus fans out genuinely different batch-correction representations.

## Inputs & Outputs

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED from skill.yaml (interface) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: python scripts/generate_skill_md.py <skill_dir> -->

**Inputs**

- Modalities: scrna
- File types: `.h5ad`
- Requires a preprocessed AnnData (`X` normalised, PCA/neighbours present)

**Outputs**

- `figure_data/embedding_points.csv`
- `figure_data/clustering_summary.csv`
- `processed.h5ad`
- `result.json`
- Processed AnnData (`saves_h5ad`) — adds `obsm`: `X_pca`

## Flow

1. Load the preprocessed AnnData; compute an `X_pca` baseline if absent.
2. Run the `--method` backend to produce `obsm[representation_used]`
   (`X_pca` for `none`).
3. Build the neighbour graph on that representation and cluster with
   `--cluster-method` at the fixed `--resolution`.
4. Write `figure_data/embedding_points.csv` + `figure_data/clustering_summary.csv`
   + `processed.h5ad` + `result.json`.

## Gotchas

- **`processed.h5ad` carries the member's integrated embedding** — the consensus
  driver reads `obsm[representation_used]` from it to compute the integration
  intrinsic panel (ADR 0029). Do not strip obsm keys before the driver runs.
- **`result.json["representation_used"]` records which embedding was used** —
  `X_pca` for `--method none`, `X_<method>` otherwise; the consensus reader keys
  off this rather than re-deriving it.
- **Fixed `--resolution` is by design** — members must produce comparable cluster
  counts for the consensus operator; sweeping resolution belongs in
  `sc-consensus-clustering`, not here.
- **scVI is GPU/stochastic** — reproducible within tolerance, not bit-identical;
  serialise GPU members (`--max-parallel 1` at the consensus level).

## Key CLI

```bash
# Synthetic smoke demo (no input needed)
python omicsclaw.py run sc-integrate-cluster --demo --output /tmp/sic_demo

python skills/singlecell/scrna/sc-integrate-cluster/sc_integrate_cluster.py \
  --input <preprocessed.h5ad> --output <member_dir> \
  --method harmony --batch-key batch --resolution 1.0 --cluster-method leiden --seed 0
```
