description: Load when removing low-quality cells and lowly-detected genes from a single-cell AnnData using QC-derived thresholds or tissue presets. Skip for the full normalize→HVG→PCA→cluster pipeline (use sc-preprocessing) or when reads are still raw FASTQ (use sc-fastq-qc → sc-count first).

# sc-filter

## When to use

The user has reviewed `sc-qc` output and now wants to actually drop
low-quality cells and lowly-detected genes — by per-cell thresholds
(`--min-genes`, `--max-genes`, `--max-mt-percent`, `--min-counts`,
`--max-counts`, `--min-cells`) or tissue-specific presets (`--tissue
brain` / `pbmc` / etc.).  This skill removes cells; it does not
normalise, cluster, or annotate.

## Inputs & Outputs

| Input | Format | Required |
|---|---|---|
| Single-cell AnnData | `.h5ad` | yes (unless `--demo`) |

| Output | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Filtered AnnData | `processed.h5ad` | post-filter, contract preserved |
| Filter stats | `tables/filter_stats.csv` | per-rule keep/drop counts |
| Retention summary | `tables/filter_summary.csv` | workflow + threshold metadata + cells/genes-retained pct |
| Diagnostic figures | `figures/filter_comparison.png`, `figures/filter_summary.png` | before/after panels |
| Provenance | `result.json` | `summary` includes `expression_source`, `warnings` |
| Report | `report.md` | always written |

## Flow

1. Load AnnData via shared loader; persist `expression_source` in `result.json`.
2. If `--tissue` is set, apply preset thresholds (overrides any matching CLI flag silently).
3. Compute per-cell metrics; mark cells / genes failing each rule.
4. Drop cells failing any active rule; drop genes detected in fewer than `--min-cells` cells.
5. Emit before/after retention tables and figures.
6. Save `processed.h5ad` + `report.md` + `result.json`.

## Gotchas

- **`--tissue` presets silently override matching CLI flags.** Passing `--tissue pbmc` plus `--max-mt-percent 30` resolves to whatever the PBMC preset declares for `max_mt_percent`, not 30.  When mixing, omit the explicit flag or override the preset by editing it in `references/methodology.md`.  Result tables record the *effective* thresholds, not the user-passed ones.
- **QC metrics are computed on demand if missing.** `sc_filter.py:617-622` calls `ensure_qc_metrics(...)` when the AnnData lacks `n_genes_by_counts` / `pct_counts_mt`, so this skill works *without* a prior `sc-qc` run.  Running `sc-qc` first is still recommended for diagnostic figures, but it's not a hard prerequisite — the routing description used to overstate this.
- **Input file missing → hard fail.** `sc_filter.py:573` raises `FileNotFoundError` on a non-existent `--input`.  Common in batch pipelines when an upstream output dir was renamed.
- **`expression_source` is recorded but does not gate the filter.** `result.json["summary"]["expression_source"]` carries which matrix the metrics came from (`layers.counts` / `adata.raw` / `adata.X`).  Filtering still runs even if the source is log-normalised — but `total_counts` / mt% interpretations become meaningless.  Check the source before relying on the thresholds.
- **`processed.h5ad` is contract-preserving, not contract-canonical.** The skill keeps whatever layers / `raw` / `uns` the input had; if upstream skipped `sc-standardize-input`, downstream skills may still mis-classify the count source.  Run `sc-standardize-input` before `sc-filter` when input came from outside OmicsClaw.

## Key CLI

```bash
# Demo
python omicsclaw.py run sc-filter --demo --output /tmp/sc_filter_demo

# Threshold-based (typical PBMC defaults)
python omicsclaw.py run sc-filter \
  --input qc_output.h5ad --output results/ \
  --min-genes 200 --max-mt-percent 20 --min-cells 3

# Tissue preset (overrides matching CLI flags)
python omicsclaw.py run sc-filter \
  --input qc_output.h5ad --output results/ --tissue pbmc
```
