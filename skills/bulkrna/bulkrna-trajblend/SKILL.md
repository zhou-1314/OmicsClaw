  deconvolution + nearest-neighbour mapping). Skip when plain cell-type proportions (use bulkrna-deconvolution);
  native single-cell trajectory inference (use sc-pseudotime).

# bulkrna-trajblend

## When to use

Run when you have a bulk RNA-seq cohort and a single-cell reference
with pre-computed pseudotime, and you want each bulk sample placed on
that pseudotime axis.  The current implementation is a sklearn-based
NNLS-plus-nearest-neighbour pipeline (PCA → kNN against ref); it does
*not* use VAE / GNN despite the skill name's connotation.

## Inputs & Outputs

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED from skill.yaml (interface) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: python scripts/generate_skill_md.py <skill_dir> -->

**Inputs**

- File types: `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.h5ad`

**Outputs**

- `tables/cell_fractions.csv`
- `tables/pseudotime_estimates.csv`
- `figures/bulk_on_trajectory.png`
- `figures/fraction_heatmap.png`
- `figures/pseudotime_distribution.png`
- `figures/trajectory_embedding.png`
- `report.md`
- `result.json`

## Flow

1. Load bulk counts + sc reference.
2. Find common genes between bulk and reference (`bulkrna_trajblend.py:117` raises `ValueError` if `< 50` genes overlap).
3. Run NNLS deconvolution to estimate per-sample cell-type fractions.
4. Project bulk samples into the reference's PCA space; use `sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors` to find each bulk sample's k nearest reference cells.
5. Estimate per-sample pseudotime as mean (and std) of the neighbour set's reference pseudotime values.
6. Render trajectory figures; emit fractions + pseudotime tables.

## Gotchas

- **Gene-namespace mismatch hard-fails at 50.**  `bulkrna_trajblend.py:117` raises if fewer than 50 gene IDs overlap between bulk and reference.  Most common cause: bulk uses Ensembl IDs while sc reference uses HGNC symbols.  Pre-run `bulkrna-geneid-mapping` to harmonise.
- **`--n-epochs` is currently a no-op.**  The argparse help text at `:354` reads `"VAE epochs (unused in fallback)"` — there is no VAE / GNN code path in this version (the script imports only `sklearn`, `numpy`, `pandas`).  The flag is preserved as a forward-compat hook; passing any value has no effect on output.  Do not report results as "VAE+GNN-derived" until that code lands.
- **Pseudotime placement is a kNN average, not a likelihood-based fit.**  Each bulk sample's `pseudotime` is the *mean* of its k nearest reference cells' pseudotimes — it doesn't carry uncertainty in the way a probabilistic model would.  Use `pseudotime_std` and `mean_neighbor_dist` (per `bulkrna_trajblend.py:184-188`) as crude confidence proxies; large neighbour distances mean the bulk sample doesn't cleanly resemble any reference cell.
- **Reference pseudotime values must be supplied externally.**  This skill consumes pseudotime; it does not compute it.  Run `sc-pseudotime` on the reference first (or use a published pre-pseudotimed reference) so the input AnnData has the relevant `obs` column.

## Key CLI

```bash
python omicsclaw.py run bulkrna-trajblend --demo
python omicsclaw.py run bulkrna-trajblend \
  --input bulk_counts.csv --reference scref.h5ad --output results/
```

- Adjacent skills: `bulkrna-deconvolution` (parallel: same NNLS proportions, no pseudotime placement), `bulkrna-geneid-mapping` (run upstream to harmonise gene IDs), `sc-pseudotime` (run upstream on the reference to populate the pseudotime column this skill consumes)
