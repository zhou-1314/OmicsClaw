description: Load when removing batch effects from a multi-cohort bulk RNA-seq dataset using ComBat (R
  or Python implementation). Skip when there is only one batch; single-cell batch integration (use sc-batch-integration);
  spatial multi-slice integration (use spatial-integrate).

# bulkrna-batch-correction

## When to use

Run when bulkrna-qc PCA or sample-correlation heatmap reveals samples
clustering by batch (cohort, sequencing run, library prep date) rather
than by biology.  Applies ComBat — preferring the R `sva` implementation
when available, falling back to a Python port.

## Inputs & Outputs

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED from skill.yaml (interface) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: python scripts/generate_skill_md.py <skill_dir> -->

**Inputs**

- File types: `.csv`

**Outputs**

- `tables/batch_info.csv`
- `tables/batch_metrics.csv`
- `tables/corrected_counts.csv`
- `tables/corrected_expression.csv`
- `tables/counts.csv`
- `figures/batch_assessment.png`
- `report.md`
- `result.json`

## Flow

1. Load expression matrix + batch metadata.
2. Try R `sva::ComBat` first; on import failure, fall back to Python ComBat (`bulkrna_batch_correction.py:427` warns "R ComBat not available (...); using Python fallback.").
3. The Python fallback short-circuits with a warning at `:165` ("Only 1 batch detected; returning data unchanged.") when `--batch-info` describes a single batch.  The R path has no equivalent guard.
4. Render before/after PCA; emit corrected table, batch-metrics table, and report.

## Gotchas

- **Single-batch input is a silent no-op (Python fallback only).**  `bulkrna_batch_correction.py:165` returns the input unchanged with a warning when only one batch is detected — but **only when the Python ComBat path runs**.  The R `sva::ComBat` path at `:421` does not have this guard, so a single-batch run on an R-equipped system may proceed with nonsense output.  Verify `result.json["n_batches"]` ≥ 2 before trusting downstream results.
- **R vs Python ComBat give numerically different results.**  `:427`'s silent fallback to the Python port can produce per-gene corrected values that differ at the 3rd decimal from R `sva` — usually inconsequential for downstream DE but visible in direct value comparisons.  The chosen backend is not recorded in the summary dict; only the warning log distinguishes them.
- **ComBat assumes the biological design is balanced across batches.**  If condition X is only in batch 1 and condition Y is only in batch 2, ComBat will remove the biology along with the batch effect.  No automatic check — sanity-cross-tabulate `condition × batch` before running, and consider including condition as a covariate in a more sophisticated tool (limma::removeBatchEffect) if confounded.
- **Negative output values are normal for ComBat-on-counts.**  ComBat operates in log-space and returns gene-by-sample matrices that can contain negative values after back-transform.  Do NOT pipe `corrected_expression.csv` into `bulkrna-de` (which expects non-negative integer counts) — use the corrected matrix only for visualisation, clustering, or co-expression analysis.
- **Silhouette score interpretation is direction-of-improvement, not absolute.**  `silhouette_before` / `silhouette_after` (in `result.json` and `batch_metrics.csv`) measure batch clustering tightness.  A drop indicates batch effect has been reduced; absolute values depend on how separable the batches were originally.

## Key CLI

```bash
python omicsclaw.py run bulkrna-batch-correction --demo
python omicsclaw.py run bulkrna-batch-correction \
  --input counts.csv --batch-info batches.csv --output results/
python omicsclaw.py run bulkrna-batch-correction \
  --input counts.csv --batch-info batches.csv --output results/ \
  --mode non-parametric
```
