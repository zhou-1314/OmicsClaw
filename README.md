OmicsClaw is an AI agent for multi-omics analysis. You describe the analysis
you want; the model picks a skill, reads its instructions and runs its Python,
R or command-line tools in your own environment, on your machine or on a
server. It ships 90 skills in seven domains, and the same agent answers in the
terminal, in the desktop app and on chat platforms.

## What's new

- A real-model routing eval (`tests/evals/live/`, run by hand) measures whether the model picks the right skill for 26 seed requests, and the CI unit-test job now also runs the launch shell, attachments, top-level and desktop HTTP tests. Four consensus skills whose scripts could not start are out of the skill index for now ([0068](docs/plans/0068-eval-hardening.md)).
- The agent framework has been rebuilt around three entry points, `oc cli`, `oc desktop` and `oc channel`, and the old `oc interactive`, `oc tui`, `oc onboard` and `oc run` commands are gone ([rebuild status](docs/FRAMEWORK-REBUILD.md)).
- The Desktop App works with the rebuilt backend, including remote mode over SSH and setting up a model from the App ([0064](docs/plans/0064-desktop-app-alignment.md), [0065](docs/plans/0065-desktop-management-pages-and-retirement.md), [0066](docs/plans/0066-desktop-remote-mode.md)).
- The agent tells you which of a skill's packages your environment lacks, and with `OMICSCLAW_SKILL_ENV=install` it can install them after you approve, into a separate overlay that leaves the base environment untouched ([0061](docs/plans/0061-adaptive-env-provisioning.md)).
- `run_skill` runs a skill's methods as parallel, scored trials and tunes their parameters for each dataset; `spatial-domains` is the first skill to support it ([0056](docs/plans/0056-ensemble-foundation.md), [0057](docs/plans/0057-ensemble-tuning.md)).
- `oc channel` answers on Telegram, Feishu, Slack, Discord, DingTalk, QQ and Email; WeChat/WeCom was removed because its adapter did not verify incoming messages.

Earlier entries are in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TianGzlab/OmicsClaw.git
cd OmicsClaw
bash 0_setup_env.sh        # creates the OmicsClaw conda environment
conda activate OmicsClaw
oc cli --configure         # choose a model provider and enter its API key
oc cli                     # chat in the terminal
```

`oc cli --configure` saves its answers to a `.env` file. It asks for one of 13
providers (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Qwen on DashScope, Ollama, any
OpenAI-compatible endpoint and others), the API key, the model, an optional
base URL, and the workspace directory the agent may read and write. The agent
loads skills from `<workspace>/skills`, so if the workspace is not the
checkout, also set `OMICSCLAW_SKILLS_DIR=<checkout>/skills` in `.env`.
`oc cli --prompt "..."` answers one question and exits. If `oc` is not on
`PATH`, use `python omicsclaw.py cli`.

Skills are ordinary scripts, so you can also run one without the agent:

```bash
make list    # every skill, by domain
python skills/spatial/spatial-preprocess/spatial_preprocess.py --demo --output /tmp/omicsclaw_demo
```

## Ways to use it

| Where | Start it with | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| Terminal | `oc cli` | Chat with the agent. `/resume` reopens an earlier conversation, `/skills` lists skills, `/help` lists the other commands |
| Desktop App | the App starts `oc desktop` | Chat, approvals and file viewing in a desktop window ([below](#desktop-app)) |
| Remote server | `oc desktop` on the server | The App reaches it through its own SSH tunnel, so the data stays on the server ([remote mode](docs/engineering/remote-execution.mdx)) |
| Chat platforms | `oc channel --channels telegram` | Owner-only text chat on Telegram, Feishu, Slack, Discord, DingTalk, QQ or Email. `oc channel --list` shows them. Set `OMICSCLAW_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_S` in `.env` first, or it refuses to start |
| Skill scripts | `python <skill directory>/<script>.py` | One analysis without the agent. Each skill's `SKILL.md` documents its options |

Conversations and the agent's long-term notes are stored in
`<workspace>/.omicsclaw/memory.db`. MCP servers listed in
`<workspace>/.mcp.json` are connected at start-up, and their tools become
available to the agent.

The agent asks you before it runs a shell command, writes or edits a file,
goes to the web, or calls an MCP tool. In the terminal you can allow a call once, allow that tool for
the rest of the conversation, or always allow that exact call; `/auto` stops
the questions about ordinary work. Dangerous commands and changes to
`.omicsclaw/` or `.env` are still asked about. The dangerous-command check
matches known patterns, and a command written to avoid them gets through, so if
you let the agent work unattended, run its commands in a container without
network access by setting `OMICSCLAW_SANDBOX=docker` and
`OMICSCLAW_SANDBOX_IMAGE` (see [`.env.example`](.env.example)).

## Desktop App

</p>

Installers are on the [Releases](https://github.com/TianGzlab/OmicsClaw/releases/latest)
page. Check each download against the
[`SHA256SUMS.txt`](https://github.com/TianGzlab/OmicsClaw/releases/latest/download/SHA256SUMS.txt)
published with it.

| Platform | Installer |
|---|---|
| macOS, Apple Silicon | `OmicsClaw-<ver>-arm64.dmg` |
| macOS, Intel | `OmicsClaw-<ver>-x64.dmg` |
| Windows, x64 or ARM64 | `OmicsClaw.Setup.<ver>-x64.exe`, `OmicsClaw.Setup.<ver>-arm64.exe` |
| Linux, x64 | `.AppImage`, `.deb`, `.rpm` |
| Linux, ARM64 | `.AppImage` |

The installer contains no Python. The App asks for an interpreter that has
OmicsClaw installed, normally the conda environment from the quick start:

```bash
conda run -n OmicsClaw python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
```

The App then starts `oc desktop` for the project you open, one backend per
project. The model comes from the backend's `.env`, which the App's Providers
page can edit; a change takes effect when the backend restarts. Troubleshooting
is in the [App guide](docs/ecosystem/omicsclaw-app.mdx), and the HTTP contract
in [`docs/core-features/surfaces.md`](docs/core-features/surfaces.md) §8.

## Installation

| Method | Command | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| conda (recommended) | `bash 0_setup_env.sh` | Python, R and the command-line tools the skills need, plus the Desktop backend |
| pip | `pip install -e .` | Terminal chat only. Most skills need packages that the conda environment provides, and the Desktop backend's FastAPI and uvicorn come from conda |

Chat platforms need their own SDKs: `pip install -e ".[channels]"` for
Telegram and Feishu, `pip install slack-sdk aiohttp` for Slack,
`pip install discord.py` for Discord, `pip install httpx websockets` for
DingTalk and `pip install qq-botpy` for QQ; Email uses only the standard
library. The dependency lists are [`environment.yml`](environment.yml) and
[`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml).

## Safety and data

Skills read and process your data in your own runtime, local or remote; the
model receives the conversation and what the tools return. OmicsClaw is a
research tool. It is not a medical device and gives no clinical diagnoses, so
have a domain expert check results before acting on them. On a server, keep
`oc desktop` bound to localhost and reach it through SSH; a non-loopback bind
requires `OMICSCLAW_REMOTE_AUTH_TOKEN`. See [data privacy](docs/safety/data-privacy.mdx)
and [rules and disclaimer](docs/safety/rules-and-disclaimer.mdx).
